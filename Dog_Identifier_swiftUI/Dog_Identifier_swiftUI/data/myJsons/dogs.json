Its gait is free and easy, and it must be able to change direction or speed instantly. Its double coat is weather resistant, with the outer coat of medium texture and length, straight to wavy. The expression is keen, intelligent and eager.\nThe Australian shepherd has a great deal of stamina and is loving, bold, alert, confident, independent, smart and responsive. If it doesn't get a chance to exercise and challenge its strongly developed mental and physical activities, it is apt to become frustrated and difficult to live with. With proper exercise and training, it is a loyal, utterly devoted and obedient companion. It is reserved with strangers and has a protective nature. It may try to herd children and small animals by nipping.\n",

It is believed that some Basque farmers brought ancestors of these dogs with them when they emigrated to Australia, then subsequently to the United States during the 1849 California gold rush. However, the breed as it is known today was developed in the American Southwest over the next few decades. The Australian dog was crossed with several breeds in an effort to produce an animal able to deal with the harsh temperatures and demands of the American West. Breeding during this period was mainly focused on ability—speed, agility, and endurance--rather than appearance, which delayed the Australian Shepherd’s recognition as a breed. Australian Shepherds became popular pets after they were featured as rodeos performers in the 1950’s, and later in Disney films such as ‘Run Appaloosa Run’. Australian Shepherds were recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1993.\n",

It is heavy-boned and compact, designed for strength and endurance. Its gait is steady, balanced and tireless. Its coat is thick and double, with a coarse outer coat and dense, wooly, oily undercoat, providing the ultimate in insulation. Although its eyes have a \"wolf-like\" appearance, its expression is soft.\nThe Alaskan malamute is powerful, independent, strong-willed and fun-loving. Its idea of great fun is to pull a sled or cart, but it also loves to run and roam. It is family-oriented, and as long as it is given daily exercise, it is well-mannered in the home. Without proper exercise, it can become frustrated and destructive. It is friendly and sociable toward people, but it may be aggressive toward strange dogs, pets or livestock. Some can be domineering. It tends to dig and howl.\n",

Its expression is intelligent, and the general impression it gives is one of a bold yet calm protector.\nThis is a serious dog, devoted to its family and its duty as family protector. At the same time, it is laid back-and easygoing, never on the lookout for trouble. It is suspicious of strangers and is territorial.

The large feet gave it a better foothold and were more resistant to injury on rough ground. The silky coat protected the dog from cold nights at high altitudes. The Afghan appears dignified and aloof, with an exotic expression and proud carriage. This dog's gait shows great elasticity and spring; the Afghan moves with its head and tail high.\nDespite its glamorous reputation, the Afghan hound is a hunter at heart, bred to chase down game over rugged terrain. While it maintains its regal bearings inside, it needs a daily chance to stretch its legs in a safe area. Its worst trait is a reluctance to come when called. It will chase small animals outside; inside, it will coexist peacefully. Though gentle with children, it may not be playful and interactive enough with them. Described by some as \"catlike,\" it is independent yet sensitive and not overly demonstrative. It is reserved with strangers; some can be timid. It has a gay, clownish side.\n",

The expression is keen and alert.\nThe American Eskimo is bright, eager to please, lively and fun-loving — in short, an enjoyable and generally obedient companion. True to its spitz heritage, it is independent and tenacious and loves to run, especially in cold weather. But it is among the most biddable of spitz breeds, and it is calm and well-mannered inside. It is good with children, other dogs, and pets and is generally outgoing to everyone.\n",

The American Hairless Terrier comes in a number of skin colors and patterns (hairless variety) and coat colors and patterns (coated variety).\nThe American Hairless Terrier is an energetic, alert dog whose curiosity and intelligence make him easy to train. The ancestors of this breed were bred to hunt. The lack of coat makes the hairless variety unsuited for hunting, but both varieties still have a strong hunting instinct and the coated dogs are fearless, tenacious hunters with seemingly unlimited energy. The American Hairless Terrier is an exceptionally friendly companion, getting along well with children, other dogs, and even cats. American Hairless Terriers enjoy human companionship immensely and will enthusiastically share any activity with their owners.

The affenpinscher has a monkeylike facial expression with long eyebrows and beard, which lends it an air of comic seriousness. This breed's rough coat is about 1 inch long on its body and somewhat longer on its head, neck, chest, stomach and legs. The coat type provided protection from vermin and harsh conditions.\nThe affenpinscher lives up to its name — \"monkey terrier\" — in both looks and actions. A terrier at heart, it is busy, inquisitive, bold and stubborn, but it also loves to monkey around, being playful and mischievous. It tends to bark and even climb. Unlike most terriers, it is fairly good with other dogs and pets. This little dog is best with a family that likes entertainment and has a very good sense of humor.\n",

The ears are well-covered with hair, which should not grow into the ear canal. The gait is balanced, with reach and drive.\nAs its name implies, the American water spaniel is a natural lover of water. Not only is it a skilled retriever and versatile hunter, but it is also a tractable fun-loving family dog — as long as it gets regular physical and mental exercise. It is sensitive and willing to please. Some can be timid. Generally good with other dogs in the household, some are aggressive toward strange dogs.

They need mental and physical stimulation to keep them occupied, fit and healthy. He will enjoy both a jog in the park as well as a nap on the couch. Keep in mind, these dogs are prey-driven and should always be walked on a leash. This hound needs a firm, but kind, hand for successful training. The American English Coonhound takes more time to train, repetition and patience are the name of the game. This breed can be easily distracted more so than the other Coonhound breeds. They need consistent and gentle guidance during training. Start training this breed early and your training work is lifelong.\n",

It has sadly been established that this mutation can be associated with a dermoid sinus. Therefore, ‘ridged’ individuals are not recommended for breeding). There is also a wire-haired variety of the breed, but it is relatively rare. The height usually varies from 50 to 60 cm (with the tolerance of 2–3 cm).\nThe Africanis is well disposed without being obtrusive: a friendly dog showing watchful territorial behaviour. The breed is independent and territorial, but highly trainable. They can however, become grumpy as they grow older, and may also become quite difficult when kept with other dogs in a pack.\n",

The Akbash Dog is slightly longer in proportion than tall, has a wedge-shaped head with pendant ears, and a long tail, usually carried in a curl over the back when the dog is moving or excited. The Akbash Dog represents a very rare and special mixture of Mastiff and gazehound characteristics that are important to maintain. The gazehound influence is apparent in the breed's long legs, deep chest, arched loin, shallow lower jaw, tucked up flank, speed, and agility, while the Mastiff's contributions can be seen in the breed's height, weight, broader head, and overall impression of power. When judging this breed, preference should be given to Akbash Dogs who exhibit a perfect balance between the two types. Gender differences can be striking in this breed. Typically the dog is proportionately taller and heavier than the female. The bitch appears feminine in comparison to the dog. There is no difference in the ability of males or females to perform as guardians.\nThe essential characteristics of the Akbash Dog are those that enable it to perform successfully as a livestock guardian. Akbash Dogs have the size, strength, and courage to challenge large predators and the speed and agility to chase fleet predators. Their temperament is calm, quiet, and steady. They are independent and capable of correctly responding to changing circumstances without human direction. The Akbash Dog is also highly suitable as a home companion or estate guardian. The Akbash Dog is loyal, gentle, and quietly affectionate with its own family, including children and family pets, but remains aloof and suspicious toward strangers. It is also by nature watchful of other dogs and may, on its own territory, react aggressively to intruding dogs. Although independent in nature, the Akbash Dog responds well to basic training. Properly socialized and trained, the Akbash Dog is an ideal family pet and home guardian.\n",

The skin is very thick, with neck folds and some wrinkles on the face.\nSince the breed was used for hunting in packs, it is very sociable with other dogs.

The well-muscled hips are narrower than the chest. The straight back is as long as the dog is high at the shoulders. The dewclaws are never removed and the feet are cat-like.\nThe Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog is dutiful and quickly trainable. This breed is named as such for its streak of \"royalty.\" It is a great watch and guard dog. They will fight to the death to defend their owners and make excellent companion dogs. Excellent with and protective of children. These are active, athletic and mindful dogs with a lot of heart. The objective in training this dog is to achieve a pack leader status. It is a natural instinct for a dog to have an order in their pack. When we humans live with dogs, we become their pack. The entire pack cooperates under a single leader; lines are clearly defined.

The appearance of the Alaskan Klee Kai reflects the breed’s Northern heritage.\nThe most distinctive characteristic of the Alaskan Klee Kai is the facial mask, which must be clearly visible due to contrasting colors. The full face mask is the most desirable. The Alaskan Klee Kai is very curious, active, quick and agile. His loyalty and alertness make the Alaskan Klee Kai an excellent watchdog, who may be territorial despite his small size. While affectionate with family members, the Alaskan Klee Kai is reserved and cautious with strangers and in unfamiliar situations.\n",

The American Mastiff is wise, kind and gentle, patient and understanding, very loving with its own people, neither shy nor vicious. It is loyal and devoted.

        "detail": "The Pit Bull immediately strikes one as being a dog of power, passion and undying willingness. The brick-like head, which is especially broad between the cheeks (to house the powerful jaws), is carried upon a thickly muscled, well-defined neck. The neck runs into a deep, thick, well-sprung chest. The American Pit Bull is a very muscular, stocky, yet agile dog that is extremely strong for his size.The tail tapers to a point. The ears are generally cropped, though this is optional. Docked tails are not accepted by the UKC or the ADBA. The eyes are round. Both the ADBA and the UKC do not accept blue eyes or the coat color merle. The American Pitbull Registry does accept a merle coat. The teeth should form a scissors bite. Its coat is made up of thick, short, shiny hair. All colors are admissible. Shades of brown to red with a matching red/brown nose are referred to as red-nose Pit Bulls. Shades of gray with a matching gray nose are referred to as blue-nose Pit Bulls.\nThe essential characteristics of the American Pit Bull Terrier are strength, confidence, and zest for life. This breed is eager to please and brimming over with enthusiasm. APBTs make excellent family companions and have always been noted for their love of children. Because most APBTs exhibit some level of dog aggression and because of its powerful physique, the APBT requires an owner who will carefully socialize and obedience train the dog. The breed’s natural agility makes it one of the most capable canine climbers so good fencing is a must for this breed. The APBT is not the best choice for a guard dog since they are extremely friendly, even with strangers. Aggressive behavior toward humans is uncharacteristic of the breed and highly undesirable. This breed does very well in performance events because of its high level of intelligence and its willingness to work.\n",

The best way to visualize the American Staghound is to blend together the characteristics of the Scottish Deerhound with the Greyhound. This is a running dog with the physical characteristics that would be referred to as the Greyhound prototype. It has long legs, a deep chest and strong muscles. The Staghound has great visual acuity, and some have been bred for some scenting ability while on course. It can be found in any assortment of color or color patterns that can be found on the Greyhound and Scottish Deerhound. There are three coat types: the \"shag,\" which more closely resembles the Scottish Deerhound; the \"slick,\" which more closely resembles the Greyhound; and the “broken,” which is in between the two. The American Staghound has all of the physical and mental characteristics needed for running down its quarry. It is known for having speeds that approach that of a Greyhound, but unlike a Greyhound, some specimens have incredible endurance.\nAmerican Staghounds are generally gentle, calm and affectionate with their family.  Due to the American Staghound's hunting heritage, the breed usually does poorly as guard dogs as the American Staghound is seldom territorial.\n",

        "detail": "The White Shepherd is a medium-sized, well-balanced, muscular dog, slightly longer than tall, with a medium length, pure white coat, erect ears, and a low-set natural tail that normally reaches to the hock and is carried in a slight curve like a saber. The outline of the White Shepherd is made up of smooth curves rather than angles. Gender differences are readily apparent. The White Shepherd should be evaluated as an all-around working dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they deviate from breed type; and how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work. Working dogs are not to be penalized under any conditions for scars or blemishes that are due to occupational injuries.\nThe White Shepherd has a distinct personality marked by self-confidence. The breed is poised, but when the situation demands, they are eager, alert and ready to serve in any capacity. White Shepherds demonstrate both herding and protective instincts. With those he/she knows, the White Shepherd is open and friendly. With strangers, she/he is observant and may be somewhat aloof but not apprehensive. They enjoy running, playing fetch or any activity with their human family. This is a joyful, active, intelligent and easy to train working dog with the ability to adapt and integrate to all kinds of social events and situations. Timidity in a mature dog or aggressive behavior is not typical of this breed. White Shepherds are very loyal and tend to be especially protective of the young of various species. With their playful and curious personalities, they make wonderful companions although some do have the tendency toward being quite vocal by exhibiting whining, grunting, moaning and sometimes howling.\n",

Faults in the breed's appearance include wall eye, kinked tail, a single coat, and a coat that is not tricolour.\nAs with all medium to large, very active working dogs, the Appenzeller Sennenhund should be well socialized early in life with other dogs and people and provided with regular activity and training if they are to be safely kept as a pet. If trained properly, they bond closely with their owners and like to seek for attention. As a result of careful regulated breeding, the Appenzeller breed, as a whole, though individual genetic lines vary, is an extremely healthy breed. Especially for a dog of its size and weight.

The length of the front leg (measured from point of elbow to the ground) is approximately equal to one-half of the dog’s height at the withers. The head is powerful with a broad, slightly domed skull and a powerful muzzle that is slightly higher at the nose than the stop, when viewed in profile. Ears may be cropped, or hang naturally, close to the skull. The Dogo Argentino should be evaluated as a hunting dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.\nThe Dogo is an intelligent and courageous dog with a strong, natural instinct to protect its home and family. Dogos are very social dogs and are happiest when included in all family activities. Dogos make a strong distinction between familiar people and strangers, so it is imperative that they be well trained and socialized at an early age. Dogos are hunters of great courage and endurance, and will work individually or in packs. They have also successfully been used in police protection work. An unsteady temperament is a serious fault.\n",

The neck is slender and arched slightly, to the chest which is narrow and deep. The ribs are well-sprung with a strong, sloping back. It should have straight forelegs and strong, powerful hindlegs. The feet are hard and foxlike. The tail is slightly curved. Overall, the Ariegeois is a talented scenthound, and affectionate and serene in the home. The Ariegeois is now being bred in Italy and used to hunt wild boar, performing well in this endeavour under Italian conditions.\nGood speed; a degree of endurance not generally found in hounds of this size.

        "detail": "(Aussie Bulldog) Australian Bulldogs have stout, compact bodies that are very strong and well-muscled. Generally, the bodies of female Australian Bulldogs should be longer than those of their male counterparts. Australian Bulldogs have a level top line and a broad chest with the brisket well let down. Their tail cartridge is straight off the back, and their tail may or may not be docked. Australian Bulldogs have a very strong, square head that is substantially deep and wide at the muzzle. They have a pronounced stop between their large, wide-set eyes. This breed has nose wrinkle. Australian Bulldogs bred for show have a near level bite and large teeth. Their wide jaw structure should be square at the top and bottom. Australian Bulldogs have a short, smooth coat that exists in a variety of colors. There are at least five shades of brindle that are suitable for show. Australian Bulldogs may also have a pied coat, meaning there is one coat color on the body that is more prominent than another. Australian Bulldogs often have a series of patches on their body.\nThe Australian Bulldog is a medium sized dog that loves being part of a family. The Aussie Bulldog is intelligent, loving and loyal with a sound temperament. Good with children and fun-loving, this breed is pretty easygoing. It will enjoy playing with a ball or Frisbee and loves to play or swim in water. It is a good watch dog but not a guard dog, though its appearance can be a deterrent. Given the alertness of this breed, the Aussie Bulldog does have the ability to be a dependable watch dog at a mature age. With its intelligence and loyalty it is a very easy dog to teach at home, but obedience training is recommended (as with any breed of dog). The Aussie Bulldog has stamina and its personality is one everyone could get attached to. This breed craves leadership from its owners. Like all dogs, they need a firm, but calm, confident and consistent pack leader and daily mental and physical exercise to avoid any behavior issues.\n",

The Australian Kelpie has a compact body and well-developed limbs. Slightly longer than he is tall, the Kelpie has a broad chest and firm hindquarters that contribute to his flexible, energized appearance. The head is long and narrow. The medium length tail is low set. The short, compact feet have well arched toes. The double coat consists of a short and dense undercoat and a hard, straight and weather-repellent outer coat. Color possibilities include black and red, each with or without tan and fawn, chocolate and blue. Kelpie owners are more interested in the breed's working ability then its appearance.\nThe Kelpie is extremely alert, eager and highly intelligent, with a mild, tractable disposition, marked loyalty and devotion to duty. It has a natural instinct and aptitude in the working of livestock, both in a confined area and in open country.

The breed's most distinctive feature, for which the breed is named, is the frequent lack of a tail. When there is a tail, it is quite short, no longer than 10 cm (4 ins), and undocked. The coat is medium length to short, straight, dense and harsh. The coat color is a speckled red or speckled blue. 46–51 centimetres (18–20 in) at the withers for dogs, with females slightly smaller. The Australian Cattle Dog is a related breed (with a long tail) that is similar in appearance to the Stumpy, but the Australian Cattle is proportionally heavier and less leggy.\nThe “Stumpy” possesses a natural aptitude in the working and controlling of cattle, and a loyal, courageous and devoted disposition. It is ever alert, watchful and obedient, though suspicious of strangers. At all times, it must be amenable to handling in the show ring. Any deviation from the standard is considered a fault and is to be penalized according to the degree of deviation.\n",

For example, a short, flat back combined with long legs place the hips higher than the withers. The Azawakh is almond eyed and thin. It moves with a distinctly feline gait and can be found in a variety of colors as well as varying degrees of refinement, though format is basically constant. The standards call for a hound from 33 to 55 pounds (15 to 25 kg); its height is 24 to 29 inches (61 to 74 cm). The coat is very short and almost absent on the belly. Its bone structure shows clearly through the skin and musculature. Its muscles are \"dry\", meaning that they are quite flat, unlike the Greyhound and Whippet. In this respect it is similar in type to the Saluki.\nRelative to its native environment, the smooth-coated Azawakh hound mentally and structurally manifests his vocation as hunter, protector and companion. Quick, attentive, distant, proud and alert, he remains instinctively reserved with strangers and gentle with those he loves. Socialize well. Especially slender and elegant, his frame and muscles are visible under a dry, fine skin. The Azawakh has a natural tendency to guard. Be sure you are this dog's calm, but firm, confident and consistent pack leader. Does best with an owner who is even-tempered, displaying a natural, but gentle authority over the dog. Independent and exceptionally fast, these dogs can reach up to 37 mph (60 km/h).\n",

They have greater endurance in sled racing than Siberian Huskies do. Gentle and playful, this cheerful dog is very fond of his or her family. A puppy at heart, they are clever, sociable and loving, easy-going and docile, though they do generally have a lot of energy, especially as puppies. Good with children and friendly with strangers, they are not watchdogs, for they bark little and love everyone. Huskies are very intelligent and trainable, but they have a mind of their own and will only obey a command if they see the point and if you do not display leadership, they will not see the point in obeying you.

The breed is an excellent and brave little watchdog and quite strong for its size. Before the mass importation of foreign breeds to Greece that started in the 1970s and '80s, the undisputed majority of small dogs in urban and rural areas were mostly Alopekis and Melieo Kynidio or Kokoni.\nThe Alopekis as a house companion is very affectionate, reliable, devoted, lively, active but not highly-strung nor yappy dog. The typical temperament is confident, outgoing, sociable, happy and very easy to train. Protective and caring towards the other house pets or animals, yet a determined enemy of vermin, a very diligent little worker, a capable hunter and retriever of game and quite playful. The breed is very good with children. As a utility dog and watchdog the Alopekis is courageous, vigilant, alert, spirited and able to cover the distance tirelessly, athletic and with very quick reflexes. At farm or city this is a very useful little working dog and escort that adapts well to all environments and is a joy to live with for dog-lovers of any age and lifestyle.\n",

The head is large and broad, with a wide muzzle. Ears are small to medium in size, high set, and may be drop, semi-prick, rose, or cropped. The tail may be docked or natural. The American Bulldog comes in solid colors, white with colored patches, and brindle. Gender differences are well expressed in this breed, with males typically larger and more muscular than females. Honorable scars resulting from field work are not to be penalized. The American Bulldog should be evaluated as a working dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.\nThe essential characteristics of the American Bulldog are those which enable it to work as a hog and cattle catching dog, and a protector of personal property. These tasks require a powerful, agile, confident dog with a large head and powerful jaws. The American Bulldog is a gentle, loving family companion who is fearless enough to face an angry bull or a human intruder. Note: It is common for young American Bulldogs to be somewhat standoffish with strangers, and judges should not penalize this. By the time the dog is around 18 months of age, however, the breed’s normal confidence asserts itself.\n",

        "detail": "As in the Portuguese Podengo, the Andalusian Hound comes in three sizes (large, medium and small) and with three types of coat (wire-haired, long-haired and smooth). This combination of factors can results in nine different varieties. There is also a dwarf or basset variety derived from a medium-sized short-haired Andalusian Hound — called Maneto from its short, stout legs — which the RSCE has provisionally accepted as a distinct breed.\nAndalusian Podencos, like other hounds, have excellent sight, hearing and smell, which makes them good hunters, often employed for hunting rabbits. Andalusians and mastiffs form the heart of the rehalas (teams of 20 to 24 hunting dogs) of central and southern parts of the Iberian Peninsula; medium and smaller dogs search out deer or wild boar, whilst the larger hounds are used for attacking the prey. One of the most typical functions of the large Andalusian hound was that of the so-called quitaor accompanying the Spanish greyhound colleras during hare hunting. The quitaor‘s job consisted primarily of flushing out the hares from their home or hiding place and killing them; then, together with the greyhounds, retrieving them for the owner. In Andalusian farmhouses the larger hounds were used as watchdogs, and the smaller hounds were used to kill rodents.\n",

The rose ears are small, thin and set high on the head. The jaws are massive, very broad, and square with hanging upper lips. The teeth should have an under bite. The tail is either straight or screwed and carried low. The short, flat coat is straight, smooth and glossy. Coat colors include red brindle and other shades of brindle, solid white, solid red, fawn, fallow, piebald, pale yellow or washed-out red or white or a combination of these colors.\nDespite its \"sourmug,\" the bulldog is jovial, comical and amiable, among the most docile and mellow of dogs. It is willing to please, although it retains a stubborn streak. It is very good with children. Most are moderately friendly toward strangers. Although some can be aggressive with strange dogs, the breed is quite good with other pets.\n",

These dogs were bred for sheer fighting capacity, and they were famed for latching onto their prey with an iron jaw which they refused to release—they could even suffocate opponents this way. English Bulldogs fell in popularity when bull baiting was outlawed in the 1830’s, but a committed group of devotees kept the breed alive and selected away any trace of ferocity. Easily recognizable by their distinctive and adorable ‘sourmug’, English Bulldogs serve as the mascots of dozens of sports teams, most famously Georgetown University. Other famous English Bulldogs include Handsome Dan, the Yale mascot, and Tyson, the skateboarding Bulldog of internet fame. English Bulldogs are simultaneously a symbol of British tenacity and an immensely popular American pet.\n",

The name may also have come from the dog's size, stemming from the French word “beigh,” the Old English word “begele,” or perhaps the Celtic word “beag,” which all mean \"small.\" He has also served as an excellent narcotics detection dog and makes a fine family companion.

It is perfectly suited to serve as a working watchdog.\nThe boxer is playful, exuberant, inquisitive, attentive, demonstrative, devoted and outgoing; it is a perfect companion for an active family. It can be stubborn, but it is sensitive and responsive to commands. It may be aggressive toward strange dogs, but it is generally good with other household dogs and pets.\n",

The term “boxer” is British, but the most recent home country for the breed is Germany. “Boxer” seems appropriate since it has a mannerism of using its front legs in combat, much as a man would in fighting. The breed was virtually ignored until World War II, when it was brought into use as a military or police dog. This helped to insure instant popularity with returning servicemen, and the breed became in demand in the United States.\n",

It stands slightly higher at the withers than at the rump. It is medium-sized with light bone. The combination of long legs and light bones endows the Brittany with remarkable agility and speed. In fact, the breed is very quick and is noted for its ground-covering side movement at the trot. The Brittany may be born tailless or have the tail docked to about 4 inches. The breed's coat is far less profuse than that of spaniels and is either flat or wavy. An overly profuse coat is detrimental when hunting in briars and is considered a severe fault. The Brittany's expression is alert and eager, but soft. The eyes are protected from briars by a fairly heavy eyebrow. The Brittany is an extremely athletic, eager dog that should be ready and able to run in the field for extended periods.\nIn temperament, the Brittany is friendly and eager to please. These friendly little dogs hunt more like a Setter due to their pointing ability, and are higher on their legs than other Spaniels. The Brittany does not require a heavy hand in training. In fact, they may quit if the discipline is too stern. Much more is accomplished with a gentle hand. They seek human attention, which makes them easier to train than some other hunting breeds. They make close working hunting dogs, fine companions, and family pets.\n",

The basset hound has heavier bone, in proportion to its total size, than any other breed. Its thick, tight coat protects it from brambles without becoming caught in them. It is speculated that its long ears may stir up ground scent, and the wrinkles trap the scent around the face. The large muzzle gives ample room for the olfactory apparatus. Such room would not be available in a miniature dog; only a large dog with shortened legs can combine the short height with large muzzle size. The basset's movement is smooth and powerful; it tends to move with nose to the ground.\nThe basset hound is among the most good-natured and easygoing of breeds. It is amiable with dogs, other pets and children, although children must be cautioned not to put strain on its back with their games. It is calm inside, but it needs regular exercise to keep fit. It prefers to investigate slowly, and loves to sniff and trail. It is a talented and determined tracker, not easily dissuaded from its course. Because of this, it may get on a trail and follow it until it becomes lost. It tends to be stubborn and slow-moving. It has a loud bay that it uses when excited on the trail.\n",

Its dense short coat protects it from being caught in brambles. Its docile temperament makes it nonthreatening to the humans it is sometimes now called upon to trail. Its gait is elastic and free, with tail held high. Its expression is noble and dignified.\nFor all its calm manners at home, the bloodhound is a tireless trailer once on the track. It is tough, stubborn and independent, yet it is so gentle and placid that it is extremely trustworthy around children — although it may not be playful enough for some children's needs. Nonetheless, it is not the lazy ol' hound dog portrayed in folklore but instead an active, playful companion. Although not the easiest breed to train for traditional obedience, it is exceptionally easy to train in tasks involving trailing. The bloodhound is reserved with strangers.\n",

Its short coat also aids in dealing with the hot climate of Africa.\nSome consider the basenji to have terrier-like mannerisms because it is feisty for a hound. More often it is considered catlike in mannerisms: clever, inquisitive, stubborn, independent and reserved. Its hunting roots are very evident, as it loves to chase and trail. It needs regular mental and physical stimulation, lest it become frustrated and destructive. Basenjis may be barkless, but they are not mute.

Its weatherproof coat is tousled and double, with a fine undercoat and a harsh, dry outer coat. It is trimmed (if necessary) to a length of about 2.5 inches. The head is accentuated by a beard and moustache, which adds to the dog's bold and alert expression.\nThe bouvier is a steady, stalwart companion that is loyal, devoted, fearless and protective. Given daily exercise, it is calm and well-mannered indoors, but ready for an adventure in the great outdoors. It is independent and confident of its own judgment, yet biddable and willing to please. It can be domineering. It is reserved, even protective, toward strangers and can be aggressive with strange dogs. It is very good with children, although it may nip at heels in play.\n",

Its hide is very thick and loose fitting, affording protection from the bites of its quarry. The border is known for its distinctive otter head, and its alert expression matches its alert demeanor.\nOne of the few terriers bred to run with the pack, the border is one of the most amiable and tractable of the group. It is inquisitive, busy, friendly and biddable. It does like to hunt and can be independent, ingredients that make for a dog that may tend to roam if given the chance.

In temperament it is full of self-importance, and its carriage reflects this attitude. Its almost human expression attracts attention and admirers. Its coat can be rough, with hard wiry hair — which is longer around the head — or smooth, with a short glossy coat.\nThe spunky Brussels griffon is full of itself, brimming with self-confidence and gusto. It is bold, playful, stubborn and mischievous. It is usually good with other dogs and pets. It tends to bark and climb, and some Brussels griffons can be escape artists.

It has an extremely dense undercoat along with an outer coat of abundant guard hairs that are long, well-fitting and straight. Its expression is intelligent and questioning; its black coloration is striking.\nThe Belgian Shepherd Dog was developed in Belgium as a herding dog to work sheep. He is enthusiastic and remarkably quick. He shows a natural tendency to be in motion. The Belgian was developed for endurance. He must be able to move and tend the flock all day and to guard it from all invaders. In addition to his inborn ability as guardian of the flocks, he is an exceptional watchdog and a tenacious and brave defender of his master and family. He is vigilant, and highly responsive to his owner's direction. He is alert, intelligent and inquisitive.

Its long ears may help stir up ground scents. Its deep muzzle allows room for olfactory apparatus. Its deep voice enables the hunter to locate the dog when it has treed its quarry. Its hair is short but dense, providing an all-weather-protective coat. Its expression is alert, friendly and eager. Its stride is easy and graceful, with head and tail held high.\nNot the prototypical house dog, the black and tan coonhound, nonetheless, makes an exemplary pet. It is mellow, amiable, calm and unobtrusive indoors. Outdoors, its strong hunting instincts take over, and it can be difficult, if not impossible, to turn from a track after it starts trailing. As befitting a dog with its heritage, the black and tan is strong, independent and stubborn. It is gentle and tolerant with children, but it may be too independent to satisfy a playful child. It is reserved with strangers.\n",

The baying, bawling, and chopping bark of Bluetick Coonhounds in hot pursuit might sound cacophonous to some, but to coon hunters it’s the music of the night.\nThe ideal owner will be happy about spending time with his hound, making sure he gets plenty of activities to keep body and mind healthy and occupied. Athletic and hardy, Blueticks are working dogs that need a job - such as hunting, obedience or agility - to stay happy. Living with a Bluetick can be very rewarding or very frustrating. These hounds are scenthounds, governed by their exceptional noses and prey drive. Plenty of exercise and a job to focus on are essential.

Its body is powerful yet agile, its jaws strong, its gait fluid, effortless, and ground covering. The head is not held high when moving, but is lowered to the level of the back, as is typical of herding dogs. Its outer coat is straight, dense, and coarse, of medium length; this, combined with a dense undercoat, offers weather-resistant protection. An unusual trait is the presence of double dewclaws on the hindlegs, which seem to be a French tradition for herding and flock dogs. Although they serve no function, they were perhaps at one time associated with the best herders, and are now a breed trademark.\nBeaucerons are uncannily intelligent and adept at any task involving learning, memory, and reasoning. They are courageous and calm, and make reliable, thoughtful guardians. This is an extremely loyal breed that is eager to please its family; however, if not properly trained, the Beauceron can run the family. Beaucerons are patient with children, but can be overwhelming to them or try to herd them. They may be wary of strangers and do not take to unfamiliar dogs. They can get along with other family dogs and pets.\n",

The Berger Picard should be evaluated as a working sheep-herding dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.\nThe Berger Picard's attributes include a lively, intelligent personality and a sensitive and assertive disposition that responds quickly to obedience training. By and large, Picards are laid back and mellow but they are known for having a stubborn streak and being reserved towards strangers. They require a lot of socialization during the first two years of their lives. Picards are energetic and hard working, alert and are not excessive barkers. Some Picards are notoriously picky eaters, and it may be difficult to decide on a diet that you and the dog agree on. The breed also has a well-developed sense of humor, making them an endearing companion, and they continue to be used very effectively as both sheep and cattle herder in their native land and elsewhere. Like many herding breeds, Picards require human companionship and lots of it. Since they can be demonstrative to their owners and enthusiastic friends towards other animals, formal obedience training and plenty of positive socialization is a must. Athletic, loyal and filled with a desire to work a long day, the breed excels in any \"job\" as long as enthusiasm and praise is a part of the task.\n",

There is a characteristic beard, which gave the breed its name. The accepted colours of the breed are solid black, brown, fawn, grey, pale fawn, white, or more or less pied. All shades of red-fawn and pale fawn are permitted. The shade should, preferably, be the same as the colour of the body. Grey and white are extremely rare; mixed colours (except with white) are considered a fault. The most common colors are black or brown with white markings. The birth figures worldwide for 2007 are 176. All born were black or brown some with white markings on the chest, chin, and legs.\nThe Barbet is not aggressive or timid, being docile and very devoted to its master. They are very sociable and fond of the water. The Barbet is essentially a water dog, used for wild fowling. Nevertheless, it has several abilities of a pointer/setter without being a true setter.

He measures 32 – 38 cm in height and weighs between 36 - 40 lbs but due the old, and no longer permitted, practice of registering mixed litters of Griffon and Basset Fauves sometimes a litter of bassets will produce a long legged dog more akin to the Griffon. They have coarse, dense fur which may require stripping. The hair on the ears is shorter, finer and darker than that on the coat. The ears just reach the end of the nose rather than trailing on the ground and should be pleated. They should have dark eyes and nose and ideally no crook on the front legs. The French standard says these are the shortest backed of all the basset breeds so they generally do not appear as exaggerated as the British Basset.\nSmart, courageous and determined, the Basset Fauve de Bretagne is a serious hunter, easily adapting to different types of game or terrain. It is also an excellent companion, being cheerful, friendly and agreeable.\n",

The muzzle should be broad with solid jaws, and its lips fully covering the mouth. Its nose is black or dark red with wide nostrils. Its ears are high set and medium in length. They are broader at the base and rounded at the tips, hanging heavily against the head. Its body is slightly longer than it is tall and slightly raised at the rump. The neck medium in length, strong, with a slight dewlap. Topline sloping slightly upward from withers to hindquarters. Chest well-developed, long, moderately wide, and well let-down with a slight tuck-up. It has a long, fairly straight croup and solid back. While its tail is set on high, medium in length and hanging to the hock, carried level to the ground or hanging down.\nBavarian Mountain Hounds are calm, quiet, poised, and very attached to their masters and family. When hunting, they are hard, single-minded, and persistent, courageous, spirited, fast, and agile, they are at ease on a rugged terrain, with a superb nose and powerful hunting instinct. However, they need a patient, experienced trainer.\n",

His elegance and expression denote great strength of character, making him a proud representative of the herding breeds.\nThe Belgian Shepherd Dog was developed in Belgium as a herding dog to work sheep. He is enthusiastic and remarkably quick. He shows a natural tendency to be in motion. The Belgian was developed for endurance. He must be able to move and tend the flock all day and to guard it from all invaders. In addition to his inborn ability as guardian of the flocks, he is an exceptional watchdog and a tenacious and brave defender of his master and family.

The tail is straight, set low, and may be any length. The coat is short and close fitting. The Blackmouth Cur should be evaluated as a working dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog's ability to work. Scars should neither be penalized nor regarded as proof of a dog's working abilities.\nThe Black Mouth Cur is a fast, hard hunter that finds game using its eyes, ears and nose. Silent trailers are preferred, although slightly semi-open on a very hot track is allowed. Never open like a hound. A loud, deep chop on bay or tree, ringing cry or slight yodel allowed. Never full-blown bawl mouthed. The Blackmouth Cur combines tenacity and courage with a strong desire to work. They are very loyal and protective of their owner and family.\n",

These dogs are extremely intelligent, and even a long run once a day would not be enough to keep them occupied. It is a very physical dog, unless it senses fragile young children or women. Needs plenty of room to run. They do best in a home with a large yard to protect. They make great jogging companions. Lack of exercise can cause a wide variety of behavior problems."

It must be able to keep out the heavy autumn rain in Scandinavia and endure the cold weather, which it does very well.\nThe Black Norwegian Elkhound is a very robust and hardy dog: very alert and full of power and pride. It is more strong-minded than the Grey Elkhound. The most recommended training method is one that focuses on motivating the dog; such as clicker training or reward-based training methods. Using punishment or dominance-based methods could negatively impact training with the Black Norwegian Elkhound. It is easy to train, but always needs something to do to be happy.

Brushes and combs just for this purpose are sold in pet stores. Bathe only when necessary, as it removes the natural oils in the skin. Like other Arctic dogs, they do not have the usual smell of dog hair. The coat is both water and dirt resistant. This breed is a seasonally heavy shedder."

        "detail": "A Blue Picardy Spaniel on average is around 22–24 inches (56–61 cm) high at the withers and weighs 43–45 pounds (20–20 kg). Its coat is speckled grey black forming a bluish shade, with some black patches. The coat is flat or a little wavy with feathering on the ears, legs, underside and tail. It has long legs with some setter characteristics. It has a long broad nose and muzzle, with thick ears covered in silky hair that usually end around the tip of the muzzle. Its chest is of medium size that descends down to the same level as the elbows. Both the forequarters and the hindquarters are well muscled. Its tail typically does not extend beyond the hock and is normally straight. The breed has many similarities with the Picardy Spaniel due to the two breeds' recent history. The Blue Spaniel is described as being softer, as well as the obvious difference in coat color. The Picardy has a brown coat whereas the Blue Picardy has a black and grey coat, which was brought into the breed by the introduction of English Setter blood. Similar in the modern era due to the close similarities of the two different breed standards. In addition, the Blue Picardy is a little faster, and has a slightly finer nose.\nIt is a versatile hunting dog, used for its ability to locate and retrieve game in harsh and adverse terrain and conditions. It is not specialised to any one type of terrain, and tends to score well in field trials. The Blue Picardy is considered to be a quiet breed, but requires a great deal of exercise as it has a high level of stamina. It loves to play, and is a responsive and obedient breed which thrives on human companionship. It is especially good with children.\n",

        "detail": "The Bracco - or Italian Pointer- should be athletic and powerful in appearance, most resembling a cross between a German Shorthaired Pointer and a Bloodhound, although it is nothing like them in character. It has pendulous upper lips and long ears that create a serious expression. It should be \"almost square\", meaning that its height at the withers should be almost the same as the length of its body. It should not however be actually square as this would render its famous rear driving push off and front/rear extension to be compromised, thus losing much of its powerful grace. The tail can be docked, mostly due to the strong possibility of injury in rough/dense terrain when hunting, however there has been a sea-change in Italy, with some now working the breed with full tail.\nBraccos are very much a people-loving dog and thrive on human companionship, having a strong need to be close to their people. They are a particularly good family dog, and many have a strong love of children. They get along well with other dogs and pets, if trained to do so - it is, afterall, a hunting breed - and must be taught what to chase and what not to. They are very willing to please as long as they have decided that your idea is better than theirs. Obedience training is a must for a Bracco, and the more is asked of them, the better they do. Harsh reprimands do not work with this breed unless the reprimand is a fair one - and harshness must occasionally be used with some dogs to remind them who is actually in charge. Although not an aggressive breed, many Braccos will alert if there is a reason, and some will bark or growl if there's a good reason. The breed loves to hunt, and they excel at it - in fact, a non-hunting Bracco is not a happy Bracco, and will act out in various other ways. Hunting without a gun (as in NAVHDA - this group does not even allow a handler to carry a gun during trials) is an area in which the Bracco can excel and this can be a great opportunity for training the dog to connect with the owner. They are an active breed, but require more mental exercise than physical exercise to keep them happy. A Bracco owner can teach games like hide-and-seek (an object or person) which fits into the breed's original and current usage, and keeps them mentally active.\n",

When hunting they are full of passion, cautious, balanced, cooperative and intelligent. They have a remarkable ease of adaptation to the most varied terrains and game. This intense pointing dog has an ability to train easily and quickly. They are people-oriented and not happy if isolated from the family. They need human leadership.

The ears are half-pricked and folded, with the tip falling down.\nThe temperament of this breed is very similar to a Jack Russell Terrier, very alert, perky and intelligent. Very friendly, loves to play and dig holes. Spirited and obedient but fearless, as watchdogs they will only bark to get your attention and then leave the rest up to you. This breed needs a firm, consistent and confident pack leader, otherwise, they will become willful and determined.

Like its close relations the other vendeen hounds, the Briquet relishes its time outdoors with its family. While they are not high-strung, they are lively and enthusiastic dogs. Bred to work in packs as well as on their own, they get along well with other dogs and are not overly possessive about anything. They are fine companion for children.

        "detail": "The Bucovina Shepherd's head is massive, slightly elevated with respect to the back line. The skull is moderately wide. The stop is slightly marked. The nose is black well developed and wide. The muzzle has the shape of a truncated cone, of the same length as the skull, well developed. It becomes progressively narrow towards the extremity but it is never pointed. The lips are thick, well applied, with strong pigmentation. This breed should have strong jaws, with healthy white teeth and a scissors bite. Level bite is allowed. The cheeks are not prominent. The eyes are small in comparison with the dimensions of the skull, almond-shaped and slanting, chestnut colored or slightly lighter, never yellow. Eyelids are well pigmented. The ears are high, “V” shaped, with rounded tips, fallen, and very close to the cheeks. The neck is moderately long, bulky and strong, without dewlap. The muscular body is massive with a well supported back. The chest is wide and tall, reaching the level of the elbows with well arched ribs. When the dog is relaxed it tends to hold the tail low, reaching the point of the hock or even lower. When the dog is alert and is paying attention or is in action, the tail is elevated. In this case it may rise above the level of the back, sickle shaped. The skin is thick and dark gray. The hair is short on the head and forelegs. On the body, the hair is abundant, straight, thicker and harder, 2½- 3½ inches (6–9 cm.) long. The next layer of hair is shorter and thick, with a lighter color. On the neck, the hair is longer and forms a mane. On the backside of the legs, the hair forms fringes of moderate length. The tail is bushy, covered with longer and thicker hair. The coat background must be white with well-defined, sand-charcoal colored, black or brindled patches. On the legs, there can be little black or other color drops. Completely white or black animals are accepted but not preferred by breeders and in show rings.\nThe Bucovina Shepherd dog was bred to protect sheep flocks and cattle herds. They are excellent watchdogs. This breed is balanced, calm, very devoted, and loves children. It does not trust strangers. An excellent watchdog for herds, dogs of this breed are courageous and very combative where potential predators are concerned. They do have a powerful bark. If strangers or animals come close to its territory, the fact is signaled by a deep penetrating bark. During the night, it patrols around the property or herds. An adult Bucovina Sheepdog needs plenty of space to run around with a large back yard.\n",

The dog is named after the Karakachans, Balkan nomadic shepherds. Due to their conservative stock-breeding traditions, they have preserved some of the oldest breeds of domestic animals in Europe: the Karakachan sheep, Karakachan horse and the Karakachan dog.\nIn the past, this mountain dog was widely used in Bulgaria as a border army watchdog. Nowadays it is used primarily as a livestock guardian dog and property guard dog. The most numerous populations of working purebred livestock guarding Karakachan dogs are found in Bulgaria and the United States. The Karakachan was officially approved as a Bulgarian old native breed in 2005. The Karakachan dog may be a descendant of ancient Balkan domestic dogs, possibly since the time of the Thracians. In ancient Thracian treasures, figures were found of big, longhaired guardian dogs with curled tails. The Karachan is part of the origin of the Bulgarian Shepherd dog, with which it should not be confused.\n",

The head is of medium length. The skull is slightly ovoid. The muzzle is large, black and almost square. It has a developed jaw and the upper lips don’t cover the bottom lips. Its lips are black. It has white, strong and evenly aligned teeth. Its eyes are well developed, open and round. The rims of the eyelids are black and the iris is a dark ochre color. The ears are set high and are long and hanging but rigid at the base. The tail is carried curved over the back. The Bolognese's height varies 10.5 to 12 inches for a male and 10-11 inches for a female. The weight varies between 4.5 and 9 lbs.\nVery serious, generally not very high energy. Enterprising, docile, enjoying his masters, the Bolognese is slightly more reserved and shy than its cousin, the Bichon Frise. Bolognese enjoy companionship of people and form a close relationship with their owners. Vivacious, playful and happy, Bolognese get along very well with other animals. This willing little dog is quite responsive to obedience training. Outdoors he's rough-and-tumble; indoors he is quiet and happy. They are friendly with strangers. Get them accustomed to people and noises at an early age. Because of this breed’s size, they are prone to Small Dog Syndrome, human induced behaviors where the dog believes he is pack leader to humans. This causes many behavior problems, including separation anxiety and being timid.\n",

The color of the eyes depends on the coat color. The teeth meet in a level bite. The full drop ears are moderate in size. The strong neck is slightly arched, moderate in length. The chest is not too big, nor too shallow. The strong, straight back is in proportion to the height and is not too long, not too short. The muscular hindquarters are straight when viewed from behind, and well angled when viewed from the side. The oval feet are close knit with arched toes. The tail’s length is in proportion to the body, thick at the base and tapering to a point. The coat is smooth and short. In colder weather there may be a soft undercoat. There is no feathering on the tail or legs and the dog has no double coat appearance. Most dogs are predominantly white with patches of colors, often with ticking on their white patches. Coat colors include liver (with a red nose), black, red, buckskin, blue, silver, tan and brindle.\nBull Arabs were originally bred for hunting purposes and were specially developed to pull pigs to the ground and hold them by the ear. Like many other breeds of dogs Bull Arabs are now highly valued as superbly loyal family dogs. Several attacks on people in several states of Australia have been allegedly attributed to the breed. Reports supplied by 80 New South Wales councils and passed on to the Department of Local Government, between 1 July 2005 and 30 October 2006, detail several attacks attributed to Bull Arabs, yet show many other breeds with a greater number of attacks.\n",

Its gait is free and elegant, with good reach and drive. Its silky coat is of moderate length, with a slight wave permissible. Long feathering on the feet is a breed characteristic. A hallmark of the breed is its gentle, sweet, melting expression.\nThe cavalier in many ways fits the bill as an ideal house pet. It is sweet, gentle, playful, willing to please, affectionate and quiet. It is amiable toward other dogs, pets and strangers. Outdoors, its spaniel heritage kicks in, and it loves to explore, sniff and chase.\n",

The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is descended from these toy spaniels. Early toy spaniels were quite common as ladies’ pets, and during the reign of King Charles II, they were given the royal title King Charles Spaniel (English Toy Spaniel). When serious show dog breeding began in England, the dog's face structure changed to have the look of the Pug until an American, Roswell Eldridge, offered a cash prize at the Crufts Dog Show for a dog that resembled those in the early paintings. With careful breeding, the shorter-faced dogs became the English Toy Spaniel, and those that more closely resembled the originals became known as the Cavalier.\n",

The outer coat of the smooth variety is short, hard and flat; that of the rough variety is straight, harsh, abundant and long, particularly on the mane and ruff. The collie's expression is an important hallmark of the breed, and depends upon the shape and balance of the skull and muzzle, as well as the characteristics of the eyes and ears. It should be bright, alert and intelligent — traits accentuated by a fairly refined head.\nCollies are impressive dogs; friendly, highly-intelligent, proud, and beautiful. They are great at understanding human's moods and they are very fond of children, making them ideal family pets. Collies require daily exercise and human interaction to be happy. Gentle training is all that is required for a Collie to learn easily and quickly. They have historically been and continue to be beloved family companions.\n",

Its double coat consists of a soft thick undercoat and slightly harsh outer coat of medium length. Its expression is alert, gentle and watchful, yet friendly.\nFun-loving and high-spirited, yet easygoing, the Cardigan is a devoted and amusing companion. This is a hardy breed, capable of a day dodging kicks, so it is agile and tireless. At home it is well-mannered but inclined to bark.

It is a breed suited for a number of tasks, rather than specializing in one, and its build reflects its ability to hunt, herd, pull and protect. It can have either a rough coat, which is straight and off-standing or a smooth coat, which is hard and smooth; both coat types have wooly undercoats, providing ample insulation from the cold. The characteristic straight angulation of the hind legs produces a short, stilted gait unique to the breed. The scowling expression and black tongue are essential components of breed type.\nDignified, even lordly, the chow chow conducts itself with reserve. It is not very demonstrative, even with its family, and is somewhat suspicious of strangers. It is independent and stubborn. It can be aggressive toward other dogs but is generally good with other household pets. It is serious and protective, devoted to its family.\n",

It moves easily, tending to roll slightly because of its wide body and short legs. The expression is soft.\nAmong the most low-keyed and easygoing of sporting breeds, the clumber spaniel is nonetheless a hunter at heart, ever ready for a day in the field.

It is a medium-sized, square-proportioned dog of moderate substance that combines strength, agility and endurance. It is not exaggerated in any way. Its movement is athletic and graceful, with a brisk, ground-covering trot. It is able to change directions instantly. It has a double coat, with a short, soft undercoat that varies in density according to climate, and a straight, flat-lying, harsh outer coat, with a slight ruff. This breed must adapt to great extremes in weather ranging from hot days to cold nights.\nNot only does the Canaan dog excel as a herder, but it has also proven itself in a variety of tasks involving dependability and obedience. This is an intelligent, devoted, docile dog that is quite tractable and willing to please. It is aloof toward strangers and protective of its family. The Canaan dog is generally good with other household pets and dogs, but it may be aggressive toward strange dogs. It is a natural guardian and tends to bark a lot.\n",

Chinooks were conceived as dual-purpose haulers, with the power of freighting dogs and the speed of sled racers. They’re the picture of stouthearted dignity, with a kindly twinkle in their dark almond eyes.\nIt’s amazing that dogs this smart and lovable were once on the verge of extinction. Happily, the Chinook was brought back from near oblivion by devotees who cherished the breed’s many virtues. They’re calm, people-oriented dogs with a special feel for children. Chinooks are trainable, eager workers who aim to please. Sledding, carting, obedience, agility, search-and-rescue work, and herding are a few pursuits they’ve mastered. Still a pretty rare breed, Chinooks aren’t easy to come by. But their fans say they’re worth the search.\n",

This hound was historically used to hunt rabbits and can work for hours without food or water. The breed also has a keen sense of smell and is primarily built for endurance over harsh terrain such as that of Mount Etna. It is the smallest of the Mediterranean island hunting hounds, the others being the Pharaoh Hounds and Ibizan Hounds.\nToday they are increasingly kept for conformation showing and as pets, due to their low coat maintenance and friendly nature, although as active hounds they do need regular exercise. A Cirneco should measure from 43 to 51 cm (17 to 20 in) and weigh between 10 and 12 kg (22 and 26 lb). As with other breeds, those from hunting stock can lie outside these ranges.\n",

Wavy facial hair gives Ceskys a sporty, Continental look, and the medium-long neck lends a dash of elegance to these game, unspoiled working terriers.\nThey are loyal family members who require continued socialization throughout their lives due to their reservednature towards strangers. Weighing in at 16 to 22 pounds, they are a comfortable size for most households and require a minimum amount of daily exercise. They are an active breed and like most terriers, love to dig. A secure backyard where the breed can get regular exercise is strongly recommended. Other exercise outlets include events like tracking, agility, earth dog and obedience.\n",

It has a beard, which gives it a mature look. The eyes are round and dark, with a gentle expression. The moderately sized ears usually hang down the sides of the cheeks, but sometimes they are cropped. Cropping is banned in some European countries. For his moderate size, the dog appears rather high on the legs. His feet are particularly adaptable to rough terrain. His legs are strong and his chest is deep. The hair is longer on the head, giving the dog bangs and a banged-up untidy look. It has a wide, sturdy head with a prominent nose, and strong jaws and teeth. The tail is pointed, reaching the dog's hocks.\nThe breed standard states that the ideal Cão da Serra de Aires is \"exceptionally intelligent and very lively.\", devoted to the flock and the shepherd but wary of strangers and a good night guarding dog.\n",

During the winter the breed is thickly clothed with a dense, double coat that allows them to easily withstand the rigors of the high Arctic. Females have a shorter coat and are significantly smaller than the males.\nThe temperament of the breed should reflect the hard working animal that it is. In general disposition, the mature Canadian Eskimo Dog is usually gentle and affectionate, exhibiting quiet friendliness or harmless curiosity, or being somewhat distant. They are very pack oriented, and if raised as a group the pack structure will be well controlled by dominant individuals. Compared to modern domestic breeds, the Canadian Eskimo Dog seems to be over stimulated by things such as food, work, fighting or play, and for this reason they should be the companions of adults, not a child’s pet.\n",

The jaws are long and powerful, with a scissors bite. The nose is large and black. The ears are pendulous and hang close to the skull. The eyes are large and oval in shape, from dark to hazel. The expression is a piercing gaze. The neck is long, clean, and muscular, and fits well into the shoulders. The forelegs are long and straight. The back is long, broad and well-muscled. The loins are wide and deep. The chest is strong and deep with well sprung ribs. The abdomen is tucked in. The hind quarters appear wide and well-muscled. The tail is set on low, strong at the base and tapering, quite long and carried in a natural curve. The gait is high-footed, flexing all four legs, but should not be hackneyed. There are two coat varieties—one with an entirely smooth coat and the other with silky featherings on the ears, legs, and tail. Acceptable colours are fawn, fallow, red, cream, black, and mouse-grey, or any of these colours broken with a minimal amount of white.\nThe breed is above all a working hound, capable of providing an excellent performance in the field on a consistent basis, under gruelling conditions that would decimate most other dogs. They are elegant, graceful and courageous. Its physical strength couples with great speed and plenty of stamina to allow it to catch and kill several types of game, from hare to blackbuck, over rough country. It is not an ideal dog for the apartment dweller, as it needs a great deal of space and exercise; although if arrangements are made to exercise the dog regularly in a sufficiently large, safely fenced area, it may do well in a flat or any other dwelling. The breed, if treated with kindness and respect, can be exceptionally loyal. They are not very friendly, and do not like to be touched by strangers. However, a Caravan should never be aggressive, as this sort of temperament is not ideal for a hunting dog, which must tolerate other dogs and human beings, especially when they are not intruding on his territory. It makes a reasonable watch dog, and can protect that which he holds dear, should the need arise. He should always be treated in a kind, consistent, fair, and respectful manner, otherwise he may develop a nervous or vicious nature—either of which are difficult to live with.\n",

Daily long walks where the dog is made to heel beside or behind the person holding the lead are essential, coupled with long, weekly or bi-weekly running sessions in a large, enclosed, safe area. Never allow a Caravan off leash on unfenced ground, as it has the ability to become selectively deaf to its master’s calls should anything catch its attention and trigger a chase. Exercise is one of the key ingredients to a well-adjusted Caravan, so if you cannot provide enough of it, please do not think of owning this breed."

        "detail": "The Carolina Dog is a dog of medium build, possessing the general appearance of a small jackal or wolf in combination with many features of a small Sighthound. The distinctive features of the breed are those that confer survival advantages under free-living conditions in the tall grassland savannah and bottomland swamp forest habitats of the South, southeastern, and Southwestern United States. The dog typically has a medium-length straight back, with a distinctive waist which sets off a deep brisket from a highly tucked-up loin. The tail is distinctive in both its fish-hook-like configuration and its variable carriage, depending on mood. The medium to large, usually upright ears and long, graceful neck are also distinctive and suggest the appearance of a small, versatile and resourceful predator, well adapted to surviving on its own in a natural habitat. In ideal conditions, a Carolina Dog should appear thin and tight. It is not inappropriate, for example, for the ribs to show slightly as in a well-conditioned racing sighthound. Individuals that are greatly overweight should be severely penalized. The dog is to be shown in a natural condition, with little or no evidence of grooming or scissoring. Whiskers are not to be removed.\nCarolina Dogs are natural runners. They have excellent noses that help them hunt wild animals, when in the wild. When kept as pets, the breed requires moderate exercise and sufficient space. They need to be exposed to a lot of social activity from a young age. Once they are trained enough, they are said to make excellent family dogs.\n",

The best way to determine the temperament of a mixed breed is to look up all breeds in the cross and know you can get any combination of any of the characteristics found in either breed. Not all of these designer hybrid dogs being bred are 50% purebred to 50% purebred. It is very common for breeders to breed multi-generation crosses. The Catahoula Bulldog has tight skin and a very short, smooth coat. In most cases the Catahoula does not have an undercoat but may develop one if it is living in a seasonal or colder climate. Ears come in rose type or button over and are sometimes cropped for a noble look. Eye color can come in brown, ice blue, gold, emerald green or a combination of all of these. Coats come in a wide variety of colors from merle to pure white.\nThough utilized as a hunting, working, and guard dog, Catahoula bulldogs are often companion animals. They are said to be loyal and devoted to their people and to have strong protective instincts; they are generally calm though also alert to their surroundings.\n",

        "detail": "The Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog is a medium to medium-large, short-coated dog, with a broad head, small-to-medium drop ears, and an undocked tail set on as a natural extension of the topline. The Catahoula is well muscled and powerful, but not bulky, giving the impression of agility and endurance. The Catahoula is a moderate breed and should not resemble either a sighthound or a bulldog in appearance. The body is just slightly longer than tall and the distance from the elbow to the ground should equal 50-60 percent of the dog’s height from the withers to the ground. Because of the breed’s name, many people assume that all Catahoulas have the so-called “leopard” markings and blue eyes. In fact, the breed is noted for its many and unusual coat colors and patterns, as well as varied eye color. The Catahoula should be evaluated as a multi-purpose working dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.\nCatahoulas are highly intelligent and energetic. They are assertive but not aggressive by nature. Catahoulas in general are very even tempered. Males tend to be more obnoxious than females, but Catahoulas are very serious about their job if they are working dogs. They make a good family dog but will not tolerate being isolated, so interaction with the dog is a daily requirement. When a Catahoula is raised with children, the dog believes that it is his or her responsibility to look after and protect those children. Many owners will say that the Catahoula owns them and they can be insistent when it's time to eat or do other activities. Catahoulas are protective and a natural alarm dog. They will alert one to anything out of the ordinary.\n",

Their coat is long and either flat or slightly wavy, and ranges from fawn to dark sable and light to dark grey. There is also a short-haired variety of this breed, but it is nearly extinct.\nThis breed is used for herding and as a pet dog. Because of its intelligence, the Gos D'Atura, like most sheepdogs, is easy to train. This cheerful dog excels at dog-sports, such as agility and doggy-dance. In spite of its appearance, this courageous dog is also used as a watch-dog. An \"all-around-dog\" and great companion. They guard sheep without needing instruction. Enough (outdoor) activity and distraction makes this dog a quiet and well-balanced home companion. This breed is appropriate for people with firm techniques and who can give the dog enough exercise. Early socialization is important, particularly if the dog will be around children. The dogs defend their family and become attached to it.\n",

The head is large, wedge-shaped, and tapers slightly to a blunt muzzle with high-set hanging ears, which may be cropped, and deep-set, oval-shaped eyes. The thick tail hangs down to the hock but may be carried above the back as a sickle-shaped hook or ring when the dog is excited or moving. Three coat lengths are accepted, all double-coated and thick. Coat colors include shades of agouti gray, fawn, and reddish, with white markings and often a dark facial mask. Solid white dogs with dark pigmentation occur occasionally in the breed. Gender differences are well expressed in this breed. Males are more massive and more powerful; females are smaller and lighter in build. Honorable scars resulting from field work are not to be penalized.\nCaucasians are spirited, intelligent, strong-willed guardian dogs. While gentle and demonstrative with family members, the Caucasian’s active defense reaction and strong territorial instincts make this breed very suspicious of strange people or dogs. They are steady and even tempered but will protect their flock, family, and property from danger - real or perceived - with lightning-quick speed. Caucasian Ovcharka have keen senses, so they are very alert and good trackers. Any change in their surroundings can result in warning barks and growls, particularly at night. The breed is slow to mature and headstrong. Socialization and patient training techniques can be used to temper the Caucasian Ovcharka’s characteristic suspicion and aggressiveness toward strange people and dogs, resulting in a mature dog with good judgment. This breed is hardy and able to adapt to a wide range of climates.\n",

        "detail": "The Cockapoo is not a purebred dog. It is a cross between the Cocker Spaniel and the Poodle. The best way to determine the temperament of a mixed breed is to look up all breeds in the cross and know you can get any combination of any of the characteristics found in either breed. Not all of these designer hybrid dogs being bred are 50% purebred to 50% purebred. It is very common for breeders to breed multi-generation crosses. Note: some Cockapoo clubs are working toward making the Cockapoo a purebred dog by multi-generation crossing, while other breeders are sticking to the basic Poodle / Cocker mix, stating they wish to preserve the heterosis effect in the hybrid mix. Ask the breeder you contact which type of Cockapoo they are breeding.\nCockapoos have become popular because they generally combine the outgoing, loving personality of the Cocker Spaniel with the low-shedding, low-dander qualities of the Poodle. Cockapoos are active, and thrive when they receive regular exercise. Cockapoos can be very agile, excelling at \"retrieve\" games and enjoying activities such as swimming. Cockapoos are frequently very needy dogs and as such are not suitable to be left alone for long periods as they frequently suffer from separation distress or anxiety. The Cockapoo is a cross-breed, not a purebred, and does not \"breed true.\" In breeders' terms, \"breeding true\" means that the pups will have consistently predictable characteristics. Cockapoos, however, may inherit the characteristics of either or both their parent breeds. While some Cockapoos appear more similar to Cocker Spaniels, others will exhibit more Poodle traits, creating a variation in Cockapoo appearance and temperament.\n",

They are of low to medium height and the base color is always black, although there may be very small patches of white on its chest and/or toes. A characteristic is the short hairs on its somewhat fox-like head and legs. The remainder of the coat is longer and wavy or curly. The height at the withers in both sexes is between 16 and 21 inches and the length exceeds the height by approximately 10%. Nowadays, some dogs are even taller; that is probably due to better nutrition and an easier life - they grow to their full genetic potential. Traditionally the tail is docked very short but, if undocked, it is carried curled over the dog's back.\nThe Croatian Sheepdog is an alert, agile, keen and intelligent dog with enormous energy and a strong need for human leadership. It is healthy, resistant to disease and inexpensive to keep. It possesses a well-developed herding instinct and is an excellent watchdog. An instinctive herder, it is wary of strangers. If socialized early, however, it responds well to obedience training. As a pet without early obedience training and exercise to occupy its athletic body and excellent mind, it can become very noisy, even destructive.\n",

The back is short and slightly sloped; the tail is high set, and when freely lowered reaches the tarsi. The forelimbs are straight and narrow-set, with the paws slightly turned out, with a long radius and metacarpus. The hind limbs are muscular, with a long calf and instep. The coat color is yellow-grey to silver-grey, with a light mask. The hair is straight, close, and very thick. The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog is a typical tenacious canterer; its movement is light and harmonious, and its stride is long.\nThe Czechoslovakian Wolfdog is more versatile than specialized. It is quick, lively, very active, and courageous. Distinct from the character of the Saarloos Wolfhound, shyness is a disqualifying fault in the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog. The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog develops a very strong social relationship - not only with their owner, but with the whole family. It can easily learn to live with other domestic animals which belong to the family; however, difficulties can occur in encounters with strange animals. It is vital to subdue the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog's passion for hunting when they are puppies to avoid aggressive behavior towards smaller animals as an adult. The puppy should never be isolated in the kennel; it must be socialized and get used to different surroundings. Female Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs tend to be more easily controllable, but both genders often experience a stormy adolescence. The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog is very playful, temperamental, and learns easily. However, it does not train spontaneously, the behavior of the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog is strictly purposeful - it is necessary to find motivation for training.\n",

Other colors, particularly variations of grey and fawn, also occur. This is a medium dog, around 25 inches or 63.5 cm at the withers, in a recent study males averaged approximately 63.0 cm and females approximately 56.0 cm at the withers. It has a short coat that is very close; on the whole the coat if kept groomed has a shine on it. A shining, shell-like appearance is greatly desired. This kind of coat makes it ideal for hot climates. This hound is also less prone to ticks and fleas, with their short coat providing easy detection. The overall appearance is very similar to that of the Sloughi, or the Rampur Greyhound.\nThe Chippiparai is a robust animal needing little or no veterinary care. It is so active during young stages. It does need lots of exercise, as it was and is a breed meant to hunt. Chippiparai is an intelligent breed and a wonderful watch dog. Contrary to the belief that it is a one -man dog, Chippiparai gets along well with people if it is properly socialized. Chippiparai loves human companionship and it hates to be in isolation. It is capable of great speed and can overtake a hare with ease.\n",

The best way to determine the temperament of a mixed breed is to look up all breeds in the cross and know you can get any combination of any of the characteristics found in either breed. Not all of these designer hybrid dogs being bred are 50% purebred to 50% purebred. It is very common for breeders to breed multi-generation crosses.\nThe chizer mixes the highly active personality of a miniature schnauzer with the big, bold attitude of a Chihuahua, making them sturdy and seemingly tough dogs. However, the chizer is a fiercely loyal companion to its owner, and is protective of their owner. Chizer’s are seen as sweet, gentle, loving dogs, which tend to be great lap dogs for their owners, and tend to shower affection upon their owners with cuddling lots and many kisses. It is a generally playful breed, and will play for a long time before tiring out and eventually taking a nap. This breed needs daily walks, and constant activity time in order to keep the breed on its best behaviour. The chizer is a good breed for single people or families without children, as it takes serious socialization towards children for the chizer to be comfortable.\n",

Its confidence, hunting instinct, keen nose and loud voice also are of significant aid in hunting underground. Agility, freedom of movement and endurance are necessary for the dachshund's work, and its gait is fluid and smooth. The dachshund has an energetic, pleasant expression. Each of the three coat varieties has special attributes: The smooth is short and shining, imparting some protection against the elements; the longhair is sleek, sometimes slightly wavy, providing somewhat more protection; the wire has tight, thick and hard hair with a finer undercoat, providing maximal protection.\nThe dachshund is bold, curious and always up for adventure. It likes to hunt and dig, tracking by scent and going to ground after game. It is independent but will join in its family's activities whenever given a chance. It is good with children in its own family, but some may snap at strange children. Most are reserved with strangers. Some bark. The longhaired variety may be quieter and less terrier-like; the wires may be more outgoing. Some miniatures are more prone to be timid.\n",

The Dachshund was recognized as a distinct breed in 1910 and has gradually increased in popularity to become a favored pet. Famous Dachshunds include Picasso’s dog Lump, who may have inspired some of his works, and Waldi, the first Olympic Mascot and symbol of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany.\n",

Its carriage is proud and alert, and its gait is free and vigorous. Its coat is short, smooth and hard, showing off the exceptionally clean-cut lines of this athletic breed.\nThe Doberman pinscher is an intelligent capable guardian, ever on the alert and ready to protect its family or home. It is also a loyal and adventurous companion. It likes to be mentally challenged and is a gifted obedience pupil. It is sensitive and very responsive to its owner's wishes, though some can be domineering. It is generally reserved with strangers. It can be aggressive with strange dogs.\n",

Dobermann was a tax collector who sought to breed an alert guard dog for personal protection. Within a decade, a breed similar to the modern Doberman Pinscher had been created, popularized, and imported to America. In America, it became a popular guard and police dog, and later a well-admired show dog. By the late 1970’s, the Doberman Pinscher was the second most popular breed in America. Today, it serves mostly as a pet. Famous Doberman Pinschers include Zeus and Apollo, ‘the lads’ from ‘Magnum, P.I.’. Doberman Pinschers are the official combat dog of the U.S. Marines.\n",

It is almost twice as long as tall, constructed to go to ground after tough quarry. Its hind legs are definitely longer than its front legs. Its gait is free and easy. It has a distinctive coat made up of about two-thirds hardish (not wiry) hair and one-third soft hair, about 2 inches in length. The head is covered with soft, silky hair, lending to the appearance of a large head. The topknot also enhances the expression, which is determined, dignified, soft and wise.\nThe Dandie Dinmont is no \"dandified\" dog; it is rough-and-tumble and ready for the hunt. Yet it functions well as a dignified house pet, affectionate but not doting. It is a loyal companion suitable for people of all ages, but it does need daily exercise to keep it from becoming frustrated. It is intelligent and very independent. It tends to be reserved with strangers and aggressive toward strange dogs. Some dig.\n",

The coat is hard, short and smooth in texture, with white as a dominating color, with one or several patches of different color combination. The tail could be long, half bobtail or bobtail.\nThe Danish–Swedish Farmdog is a very friendly, easygoing breed. Not only does it work on farms as a rat extinguisher and alerting to intruders, but it is also a companion to adults, and is known to befriend and play with the children of the household. The Danish–Swedish Farmdog is unlike a terrier - even though it is often mistaken as one - it is very mild and gentle in temper. Unlike the high-strung nature of the terrier, the nature of the DSF allows it to do its job, as well as be calm and loving during times without work. This makes it an ideal house companion. The DSF is a not a high energy dog, but loves having a job. The breed is new to the USA, and can only now start to be seen in sports such as flyball and dog agility. The DSF is also known for its excellent mousing skills and can perform sports such as going to ground and earthdog. They are also very speedy and quick, and love all types of lure coursing.\n",

The dingo is the largest terrestrial predator in Australia, and plays an important role as an apex predator. However, the dingo is seen as a pest by livestock farmers due to attacks on animals. Conversely, their predation on rabbits, kangaroos and rats may be of benefit to graziers.\nThe Dingo has intense eyes that vary in color from yellow to orange. The very mobile, small, rounded ears are naturally erect. The well furred, appearing bushy, tail is relaxed and has good length. The hindquarters are lean and muscular. The coat is soft. Its length, density, and texture vary according to climate. Typical coat colors are yellow-ginger, but can occur in tan, black or white, including an occasional brindle; albinos have also been seen. All purebred Dingoes have white hair on their feet and tail tip. Unlike most other breeds, Dingoes do not have dewclaws.\n",

        "detail": "The Drever's most noticeable characteristic are its long body and short legs, inherited from the Westphalian Dachsbracke, but as a working dog these features are not exaggerated. It has short fur, and is of any color with white markings (but not all white, which has been linked to deafness.) The breed has the typical drop (hanging) ears of a hound, and a long tail. The maximum height of a Drever is 38 cm (15 ins) at the withers, which is about 15 cm (approx. 6 ins) shorter than a long legged hunting hound with the same size body. The Westphalian Dachsbracke is about 2 cm (less than an inch) shorter than the Drever.\nAlert, calm, friendly and even, the Drever is known for the ongoing slight wag of his tail. The Drever often wants to continue working long after its human companion has satisfied his own hunting instinct. It has a first-class nose and is a powerful tracker. Because of its short legs, it is slower than other hounds. This makes it ideal for maneuvering game toward the hunter's gun. The Drever is a steady worker that hunts hare, fox, and occasionally deer; but this dog has the courage to pit himself against even a wild boar. In such cases, he circles and dodges the prey, warning the hunter by barking furiously. The Drever has an excellent nose and a musical voice which is much larger than his size would seem to warrant. The Drever was bred to be tenacious on the hunt and therefore it is very important that the owners of this breed are just as stern when dealing with him in order to show him where his place is among his human pack. Owners who are determined and consistent with the rules, displaying a natural firm but not harsh authority over the dog will bring out the best in this breed. Passive owners will find the dog to become stubborn and headstrong. Drevers that lack in mental and physical exercise and/or leadership will develop quirks in their temperament. Socialize this dog well.\n",

The nose and lips are black and the eyes are dark. The feet are small and rounded. The ears are triangular, set high on the head. The firm, straight forelegs and flexible hind legs are well-muscled. The skull is slightly rounded, with a distinct stop and a moderately long muzzle. The jaws are strong. When the dog is relaxed, the tail hangs limply. The cat-like feet are compact and covered with long hair. The forehead is strong and slightly rounded. The body is well balanced and close to the ground.\nThis easy care, obedient house-dog is a friendly and charming companion. The Smoushond tends to be quiet with those he does not know, but is loving with those that he does know. This skillful, intelligent dog has considerable adaptability. It is alert with a sense of humor. Dependent, sober and sensitive, it makes a good watchdog. Do not allow this dog to become yappy. They need to be corrected if their barking becomes obsessive. They get along well with children and happily accept the family cat. Most Dutch Smoushond get along well with other dogs. The Dutch Smoushond is eager to please, which means training it is not hard. It is important, though, to ensure that you are consistent toward it because some can try to take over if they get an idea that their handler is rather easy-going. Proper human to canine communication is essential.\n",

The English cocker has a driving, powerful gait that covers ground effortlessly. The coat is of medium length, silky in texture and either flat or slightly wavy. The feathering should not be so profuse that it becomes a hindrance in the field, but it should be long enough to protect the underside of the dog. The expression is soft and melting, yet dignified.\nThe English Cocker Spaniel is merry, affectionate and even-tempered. They are easily-trained, are willing workers and excellent companions. They exhibit enthusiasm in the field, accompanied by an incessant action of the tail. Dogs exhibiting sluggish or hyper-active temperaments are to be faulted. They exhibit balance, both in motion and while standing. The head is especially characteristic of the breed, having a brainy appearance indicating high intelligence. The muzzle is also distinctive.

        "detail": "The English setter is an elegant and athletic hunting dog with the ability to run tirelessly at a good pace. Its trot is ground-covering and effortless, with the head held proudly and a lively tail. The coat is flat, with feathering on the ears, underside, backs of legs, underside of thighs, and tail. Its markings are distinctive, consisting of flecks of color, sometimes with patches, on a white background. The combination of good looks and hunting ability make the English setter a perfect gentleman's hunting companion. The Laveracks tend to be larger, carry more feathering, often have deeper muzzles and usually hold their tails nearly level when on point. The Llewellins tend to be smaller and faster, with less coat and often larger patches of color. They tend to hold their tails straight up when on point.\nBred to cover a lot of area when hunting, the English setter is a lively dog that loves to hunt and run. This is especially true of dogs from field lines. If not given sufficient exercise, they can be overly lively inside. With daily exertion, however, they are calm and tractable house dogs. Those from conformation lines are particularly laid-back and gentle and excel with children and less active adults. This is an amiable, easygoing breed that gets along well with children, strangers and other dogs.\n",

Absolute soundness and proper muscle tone is a must. Head properties should remain free of exaggeration so as to not compromise breathing and/or obstruct normal vision.\nThe King Charles is a friendly breed, to the extent that it is not typically as suitable as a watchdog as some breeds, though it may still bark to warn its owners of an approaching visitor. It is not a high energy breed, and enjoys the company of family members, being primarily a lapdog. Although able to bond well with children and tolerant of them, it will not accept rough handling. It prefers not to be left alone for long periods. Known as one of the quietest toy breeds, it is suitable for apartment living. The breed can tolerate other pets well, although the King Charles still has the hunting instincts of its ancestors and may not always be friendly towards smaller animals.

They’re muscular, long-backed cattle dogs with short, sturdy legs. They stand from 16 to 21 inches at the shoulder, with females at the lower end of the scale. Their dark eyes draw you into an attentive, friendly face. Bred to move cattle up and down sloping pastures, Entles are famous for agility, balance, and rugged determination.\nThey may be reserved with strangers. Entles are an active, high energy and physical breed, with above average exercise requirements, so they are not a dog for the casual owner. Entlebuchers do best when they have a job. Although the Entlebucher loves and is devoted to children, his shepherding instincts can make integrating small children and a puppy a bit tricky. The Young Entle can become possessive and begin to consider children to be “his own” to herd and watch over. Being exceptionally strong for his size, the Entle can easily overwhelm a child. Very careful consideration should be taken when considering adding this breed to a family with small children.\n",

It gets along well with horses, dogs, children and other pets. It is an avid sniffer and trailer, however, and needs daily exercise in a safe area.

Ears are erect and triangular, the tail carried in a curve over the back. The coat is a medium long double coat with straight coarse guard hair and a soft thick undercoat.\nHighly aggressive towards large predators, they are calm and well-tempered with people, although they can be good watchdogs and if encouraged will be protective against human intruders.

Their croup is wide, long, and slightly sloping towards the tail. The tail is long, bears thick fir, erected in a form of a sword when the dog's excited. The chest is moderately wide, while the belly is reasonably tucked up. The chests are scimitar in form, reaching the hocks or slightly longer in some cases. The legs are strong and straight; feet are oval and compact. The dog's pace is of a trotter, rather than of a skid, sliding just above the ground so typical to other German Shepherds' cousins.\nThe East European Shepherd is balanced, confident and intelligent. VEO is an attentive, active, self-assured dog that appears calm and quiet but constantly monitors situation and is ready to \"turn on\" on owner's command. The East European Shepherd has an active defensive reaction, distrusts strangers and can be aggressive when needed but under no circumstances it should be inclined to unmotivated aggression. VEOs excel as K9 and personal protection guard dogs or as companions. East European Shepherds are working dogs and need a regular exercise. They were bred for their intelligence and they are curious and quick learners. Their ability to withstand extreme climates allows them to live outside, as well as inside, in a house or an apartment. They perform well as hunting dogs and can work as draught dogs in a group of the same.\n",

English Shepherds are never merle as Aussies frequently are. They are generally not square in body like an Aussie. English Shepherds tend to be larger than Border Collies but are most readily distinguished from Border Collies by their very different upright, loose-eyed herding style. The coat is medium length and can be straight, wavy, or curly. There is frequently feathering on the legs and tail, as well as on the ear. As a working dog, the coat should be easy to keep, requiring very little grooming. Dirt tends to just fall away. English shepherds tend to shed quite a lot and fur may be found on and under furniture, clothes, and carpeting. The primary coat colors are: sable and white (clear and shaded), tricolor, black and white, and black and tan. Other variations such as solid dogs of any color, piebalds, and red nosed tricolors and sables also exist but are not common.\nThe English Shepherd temperament is the defining characteristic of the breed, with high intelligence and often a unique type of kindness for those in his home, both animals and people. The English Shepherd is often an independent worker. English Shepherds are adaptable and learn routines quickly. Some can be watchful of strangers and are more one-person dogs. However, once he accepts people or children or stock as his own, there are few better caretakers than an English Shepherd. The English Shepherd frequently exhibits an independent, bossy or \"enforcer of the rules\" streak in his temperament. If the dog's desire to enforce order is not channeled and directed to a suitable end by a strong, confident leader, he may exhibit many undesirable behaviors. Nevertheless, English shepherds can thrive as companion dogs in environments that provide sufficient mental and physical stimulation.\n",

        "detail": "The Eurasier is a balanced, well-constructed, medium-sized Spitz (Spitzen) type dog with prick ears. It comes in different colors: fawn, red, wolf-grey, solid black, and black and tan. All color combinations are allowed, except for pure white, white patches, and liver color. Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) standards call for the Eurasier to have a thick undercoat and medium-long, loosely lying guard hair all over the body, with a short coat on the muzzle, face, ears, and front legs. The tail and the back of the front legs (feathers) and hind legs (breeches) should be covered with long hair. The coat on the Eurasier's neck should be slightly longer than on the body, but not forming a mane. The breed may have a pink, blue-black or spotted tongue.\nEurasiers are calm, even-tempered dogs. They are watchful and alert, yet reserved towards strangers without being timid or aggressive. Eurasiers form a strong link to their families. For the full development of these qualities, the Eurasier needs constant close contact with its family, combined with understanding, yet consistent, training. They are extremely sensitive to harsh words or discipline and respond best to soft reprimand. The Eurasier is a combination of the best qualities of the Chow Chow, the Keeshond, and the Samoyed (dog), resulting in a dignified, intelligent breed. Eurasiers were bred as companion dogs; as such they do poorly in a kennel environment such as those commonly used for institutionally trained service dogs, nor are they well suited for the social stresses of working as a sled or guard dog. Training should always be done through family members, not through strangers or handlers. Eurasiers should never be restricted to only a yard, kennel, crate, or chained up. They would pine and become depressed. Within these limitations, Eurasiers can work very well as therapy dogs. This breed enjoys all kinds of activities, especially if the activities involve their family. Eurasiers are calm and quiet indoors, outdoors they are lively and enjoy action. Eurasiers rarely bark but if they do, they usually have a good reason.\n",

Lappies are agile dogs of effortless movement, capable going from a trot to full gallop in a second flat.\nFew Lappies today in America have seen a reindeer, but they adapt well to other kinds of work, including obedience, agility, tracking therapy, and herding other types of livestock. When working, Finnish Lapphunds are agile, alert and noisy. While interacting with people, however, the breed is calm, friendly, and very submissive.

It is square-proportioned, and without exaggeration, quick and light on its feet. It has the conformation and temperament to hunt actively and tirelessly under the coldest of conditions. Its double coat, consisting of a short soft undercoat and harsh straight outer coat about 1 to 2 inches long, provides insulation from the snow and cold, allowing it to hunt tirelessly under the coldest of conditions.\nLike most spitz breeds, the Finkie is independent and somewhat stubborn, although it is more hunting oriented than other spitz breeds. It is alert, inquisitive and playful, but it is also sensitive, tending to be devoted to one person. It is a breed conscious of its place in the dominance hierarchy, and some males can try to be domineering. It is good with children, and generally good with other pets, but it can be aggressive to strange dogs. It is reserved, even aloof or suspicious, with strangers. In keeping with its barking heritage, the Finkie is proud of its barking ability and likes to show it off — loudly!\n",

The expression is noble, solemn, dignified but somewhat melancholic. The Fila appears self-assured and calm but is never absent in expression. When at attention, the gaze of the Fila Brasileiro is firm, alert and unwavering. Another typical characteristic of the breed is its gait, which is similar to that of a camel, moving two legs of one side at a time. The gait gives it a typical rolling lateral movement on the throat and the hindquarters which is accentuated when the dog's tail is raised. The head is typically lower than the backline. The characteristic carriage and gait has earned it great success in dog shows.\nThe Brazilian Mastiffs are known to be naturally protective. It is also known for its extreme wariness of strangers and agility when protecting or defending its master. The dedication and obedience of the Fila Brasileiro has found its way into Brazilian saying \"As faithful as a Fila\". The Fila Brasileiro temperament is what characterizes the dog. The Portuguese word for their temperament is Ojeriza, which directly translated into English means dislike and distrust. The socialization period (about the first year with the first 6-8 months being the most important) of the dog's life is crucial to the temperament of the individual dog. If the pup is exposed to a lot of people in a positive manner (known as 'socializing'), the pup (keeping in mind the dog's natural protective instincts) can be encouraged to behave in a calm manner in public, but emphasis should be placed on the fact that socialization is done differently from other breeds. Despite extensive socialization, the fila is instinctively protective and will naturally guard and protect its owner, their family members and the family pets; this is not something that needs to be trained, it is an innate trait. Strangers should not be left unattended with a Fila and, like all other guardian breeds, it may not be the best choice for those who have frequent visitors to their homes. Lack of all socialization with strangers at a young age will result in a dog which is very anti-social.\n",

A normal dog has a muscular appearance with a deep chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour, and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip. The hair is medium, dense, with long feathers on the ears, backs of the legs and tail. It has some waviness on the chest and otherwise lies flat on the body. The normal colour of a French Spaniel's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver.\nThe French Spaniel has a friendly and outgoing personality and is well balanced and patient. It is not a naturally aggressive dog, is eager to please and thus can be trained easily. A dog of this breed will form a strong bond with its master, being typically a working dog. It has a high level of stamina and requires vigorous exercise.\n",

Size is 65 to 72 cm (25.6 to 28.3 ins) at the withers, females slightly smaller. The colour of the coat is white and black, with a black mantle, sometimes speckled or ticked with black or blue. Pale tan dots are above each eye as well as tan on the cheeks, below the eyes and ears, and below the tail. Sometimes a tan marking is found on the base of the upper thigh, which is called the 'roe buck mark'. Faults are listed as deviations in appearance that have an effect on the health and working ability of the dog, as well as indication of crossing with Foxhounds or being off-colour, indicating that a dog with such faults should not be bred.\nThe breed is noted for its perseverance on the hunt as well as a good nose and voice. Unusual for pack dogs, it is friendly and easy for humans to manage.\n",

The outline of the German Shepherd Dog is made up of smooth curves rather than angles. The head is in proportion to the size of the body, strong without appearing coarse or fine. Gender differences are readily apparent. The German Shepherd Dog should be evaluated as an all-around working dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.\nThe German Shepherd Dog is confident and fearless, willing to be approached, yet a certain level of aloofness towards strangers is acceptable. When working, the German Shepherd is alert and eager, adapting well to new tasks. Lack of confidence is a serious defect in the character of a German Shepherd. The structure of this breed was designed for efficient locomotion, particularly at the trot, so poor movement is another serious fault.\n",

Using a variety of German sheepdogs as his foundation stock, von Stephanitz developed a distinctive breed in a very short period of time, due in large part to the authoritarian practices of the German dog fancy at that time. Von Stephanitz emphasized utility and intelligence in his breeding program, enabling the German Shepherd Dog to switch easily from herding duties to other fields of work, particularly military and police work. The breed was just gaining notice in the United States when World War I broke out. All things German were shunned and popularity slumped. After the war, however, movie star Rin-Tin-Tin stimulated interest in the breed again. The striking good looks of this breed, combined with its remarkable intelligence and loyalty, have made it a favorite working and companion dog.\n",

This is an active dog that can become frustrated and \"creative\" if not given ample daily exercise, both mental and physical. It is a devoted family pet, although at times it is overly boisterous for small children. Because part of its heritage includes hunting mammals, some can be aggressive to small pets unless raised with them. It is a sensitive breed, responsive to gentle training.

The Great Dane is most noteworthy for its majestic carriage and appearance — the \"Apollo of Dogs.\"\nThe Great Dane is gentle, loving, easygoing and sensitive. It is generally good with children (although its friendly overtures may overwhelm a small child) and usually friendly toward other dogs and pets. It is powerful but sensitive and responsive to training. It makes a pleasant, well-mannered family companion.\n",

Despite its name, the Great Dane is a German breed. During the 15th and 16th centuries, German forests were filled with game, and hunting wild boar with dogs was a favorite pastime of German nobility. Each lord kept large numbers of boarhounds, which they carefully bred to improve their size, power, and endurance. When game in the forests began to dwindle, the large breeding kennels disappeared but the Great Dane continued to be a favorite with German aristocrats. Great Danes were exhibited at the first German dog show in 1863, and the first Danes were imported into the United States not long thereafter. In this country, Great Danes are popular family companions for people who admire their regal appearance and affectionate personalities.\n",

The undercoat is thick in winter for warmth but thin in summer.\nThe German wirehaired pointer is both a rugged bird dog and amiable companion. It has the energy to hunt for hours, so it must be given a daily outlet lest it becomes destructive. It is a responsive breed, although it tends to be stubborn. It retains a guarding instinct, so it is often aloof, even protective, toward strangers as well as strange dogs. It is generally good, if sometimes overly boisterous, with children.

The Gordon setter carries a thicker coat than the other setters. The hair is straight or slightly wavy, always soft and shiny. Longer feathering is on the ears, underside, backs of legs, and tail. The whole impression should be of a rugged dog capable of withstanding a long, active day in the field under a variety of conditions.\nThe Gordon setter is a capable, close-working bird dog. It can run and hunt all day, and this kind of energy needs a regular outlet or the dog is apt to become frustrated. Gordons make lively, enthusiastic companions and need the company of lively people. Somewhat more protective than the other setters, they are reserved toward strangers and sometimes aggressive toward strange dogs. The Gordon has earned its reputation as a devoted family dog.\n",

Ever watchful, the German Pinscher does not bark frivolously, but does sound the alert to intruders. A quick learner, the German Pinscher is nonetheless not inclined to obey unless there's a good reason to do so. The breed is playful and affectionate, and good with considerate children.

It has tremendous muscle mass and light legs, further enhancing speed. The feet are long and narrow, giving maximum leverage. The long tail serves as a rudder and brake when running at high speed. The coat is short and smooth. Two types of greyhounds are available: AKC (show) and NGA (racing). Retired NGA greyhounds are smaller, sturdier and faster than show dogs and may be more inclined to chase small animals.\nKnown as \"the world's fastest couch potato,\" the greyhound is quiet, calm and extremely well-mannered indoors. They are good with other dogs, and with other pets if raised with them; outdoors, they tend to chase any small thing that moves. They are reserved with strangers, very sensitive and sometimes timid. Despite their independent nature, they are eager to please.\n",

The first and immediate impression of a Grand Bleu de Gascogne should be that of a hound with substance and staying power. Considering the breed's long hunting history, individual hounds should have moderate bone and ample muscle. Males are heavier than females. Defects such as bull necks, out at the elbow, loaded shoulders, or a \"beef steer\" profile, should not be confused with masculinity. Likewise, defects such as a shallow muzzle, poorly formed chest, extremely narrow pelvic region and general frailty should not be confused with femininity.\nA trail hound of moderate speed, which at creation was used to hunt wolves but since the demise of the wolf, has since successfully adapted to hunting wild boar, deer, fox and hare. The Grand Bleu de Gascogne hunts in a leisurely, methodical manner and possesses, in the extreme, a great amount of determination, tremendous endurance, desire, self confidence, sagacity, remarkable scenting ability, a deep, powerful melodious voice, a distinct coat color and an aristocratic form. Of even temperament, essentially friendly. Some individuals may be very outgoing, while others are somewhat reserved in nature, but never shy or vicious. As a hunting/working Scenthound breed, and being called upon to work in close proximity with other hounds and their handlers, aggression towards other hounds and people is to be considered a fault. Extreme shyness or viciousness is a disqualification.\n",

They are pack dogs, so owners should either spend a lot of time with them or get a second dog or cat. They have a happy and confident personality, which can sometimes manifest itself as disobedience, but they are great companions.\nThe UK Kennel Club conducted a health survey of Basset Griffon Vendéens (Petit and Grand varieties combined) in 2004. This is apparently the only completed health survey (as of July 16, 2007) that might include Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen, but it is unclear what proportion of dogs in the survey were Grand Basset Griffon Vendéens instead of the more common Petit.\n",

Its build is slightly longer than tall, giving ample room for movement without interference between fore and hind legs. The trot is ground-covering and efficient. The coat is flat, straight and of moderate length, with longer feathering on ears, backs of legs, belly, chest and tail, providing protection from briars without becoming entangled in them. The rich mahogany color is just beautiful.\nThe Irish setter was bred to be a tireless and enthusiastic hunter, and it approaches everything in life with a rollicking, good-natured attitude, full of gusto and fervor. Given a daily outlet for its energy, it makes a pleasant companion. Without ample exercise, it can be overly active inside or become frustrated. It is an amiable breed, eager to please and be part of its family's activities. It is good with children, but can be too rambunctious for small children. It is less popular as a hunter than the other setters.\n",

The depth of chest is equal to the length of the foreleg. The tail is carried in a loose curl over the back. There are two types of coat, long and short, and both are thick and extremely weatherproof. There is a marked difference in appearances between the sexes. The Icelandic Sheepdog should be evaluated as a herding and drover dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.\nIcelandic Sheepdogs are tough and energetic. Hardy and agile, they are extremely useful for herding and driving livestock or finding lost sheep. However, the dogs are not known for hunting.

The stunning coat—vivid red “islands” floating on a sea of pearl white—has a practical function: It enables hunters to spot their dog at a distance. The handsome face projects a keen but kindly expression.\nThe Irish Red and White setter can be the most devoted and affectionate of dogs making them ideal all-round family dogs. They are extremely intelligent and respond well to proper training but they do need to have plenty to occupy them. They thrive best in active families, where they have outlets for their high energy, and require space to run freely. Young puppies do not require much exercise but once they reach maturity the breed's working instincts mean they require enough space to be able to run hard and fast for a long distance.

The general appearance suggests both dash and endurance. The gait is smooth and ground-covering. The coat is one of the breed's distinctive features. The body is covered with a double coat consisting of crisp ringlets. This combination imparts water, weather and thorn resistance to the dog, enabling it to hunt in the harshest of conditions. The Irish water spaniel's expression says it all: alert, intelligent and quizzical.\nLike most dogs of the American Kennel Club Sporting group, the Irish Water Spaniel is essentially an active, willing and energetic companion. Because it has been bred from stock used to fetch game and return it to hand without a fuss, it has the natural instinct of wanting to please. Its keen sense of working as a team makes it a relatively easy dog to train and discipline. Because of its great intelligence and quizzical nature, it has the reputation of being the clown of the spaniel family and will do ordinary things in extraordinary ways to achieve that which is asked of it. Some individual dogs can be very wary of strangers and not every IWS can be trusted to get along with other pets. Early socialisation and training is a must.\n",

Jagdterriers possess a spirit of liveliness and speed at work, yet are regal at rest. \"Alert,\" \"athletic\" and \"active\" describes the ambience of the Jagdterrier. A bit of fire is always evident in its expression. Physically, individuals should exhibit a square (though not broad) build, standing squarely and true over the feet. A deep and narrow chest allows the dog to easily enter dens. Leg length is in proportion to the rest of the body, avoiding both stubbiness or legginess. The tail is set fairly high and straight, and is gaily carried. The tail posture, while the dog is working, will be wayward and is not important. Though cropped, the remaining tail must be long enough to serve as a handle, should the hunter need to pull the terrier from a den. The coat may be either harsh or smooth; the important factor for coats of working terriers being that the coat must be thick and ample for turning briars and fangs.\nThis terrier breed is a clever hunter, unrelenting, tough, and robust. The Jagdterrier is unafraid of the most formidable wild game and very intent in the pursuit of such game. The breed is highly intelligent and affable with its master and other hunters. Considering its determination to work, and its combustible energy, the breed should not be selected strictly as a pet, though they are totally people friendly. Dash, gameness and pluck are all descriptive of a properly bred Jagdterrier. The Jagdterrier, bred solely by hunters over its existence, has maintained the fearless characteristics of early day den terriers.\n",

        "detail": "The Japanese Spitz is a small dog, around 33 cm (13 ins) at the withers, with a somewhat square body, deep chest, and a very thick, pure white double coat. The coat consists of an outer coat that stands off from the soft inner coat, with fur shorter on the muzzle and ears as well as the fronts of the forelegs and the hindlegs. A ruff of longer fur is around the dog's neck. It has a pointed muzzle and small, triangular shape prick ears (ears that stand up.) The tail is long, heavily covered with long fur, and is carried curled over and lying on the dog's back. The white coat contrasts with the black pads and nails of the feet, the black nose, and the dark eyes. The large oval (akin to a ginkgo seed) eyes are dark and slightly slanted with white eyelashes, and the nose and lips and eye rims are black. The face of the Japanese Spitz is wedge-shaped. They share a common resemblance with the white Pomeranian dog, Samoyed and American Eskimo Dog.\nActive, loyal, and bright, the Japanese Spitz are known for their great courage, affection and devotion making them great watchdogs and ideal companions for older people and small children. Most Japanese Spitz are good watch dogs, despite their relatively small size, and they have a tendency to bark to warn of arriving strangers. The Japanese Spitz is first and foremost a companion dog and thrives on human contact and attention, preferring to be a member of the family. They are known as very loyal dogs. They enjoy being active and love to be in the outdoors. They are intelligent, playful, alert, and obedient, and particularly excellent and loving toward children. Unlike many other dogs, the Japanese Spitz will customarily have his or her tail flipped onto its back. In some cases this is thought to be dominant behaviour, but in the Japanese Spitz case this is normal bearing.\n",

Its hallmark coat is double, consisting of a dense wooly undercoat and a coarser outer coat that is wavy or curly. The undercoat is trapped in the outer coat so that it forms strong, felty, tassel-like cords. This coat helped protect the dog from the elements as well as the teeth of tough adversaries. It also helped the dog to blend in with its flock.\nThe Komondor, being naturally wary of strangers, makes an excellent house guard dog. They are devoted to their master and will defend him against attack by any stranger. This trait makes it advisable that the dog only be used as a herd/flock guardian/protector, not for driving. When mature, the breed is an earnest, courageous, very faithful herd/flock guardian. While a puppy, the Komondor is playful.\n",

The tail, which is typically curled, completes the distinctive silhouette. The Kangal Dog has a double coat that is moderately short and quite dense. The Kangal Dog has a black mask and black velvety ears that contrast with a whole body color which may range from light dun to gray. Honorable scars or other evidences of injury resulting from working in the field are not to be penalized.\nThe Kangal dog is calm, controlled, independent, powerful and protective. They may be aloof towards strangers, but a well-socialized Kangal Dog is friendly with visitors and especially children. They must never be shy or vicious. A well-trained Kangal is sensitive and alert to changing situations, responding to threats with judicious warnings and courageous action if necessary. They make good guardians of livestock and humans alike, but they may not be suitable for inexperienced dog owners, as the independent intelligence of the Kangal makes for a difficult pupil.\n",

The body is either square or slightly longer than tall. The tail is thick and may be loosely rolled over the back or carried over the back in a sickle position. Gender differences in this breed are very apparent. Typically, males are larger with heavier heads while females have more fox-like heads. The appearance of the Jindo gives the impression of intelligence, strength, and agility.\nThe Jindo is an enthusiastic hunter, able to follow cold trails of rabbit, raccoon, and badger. In packs, Jindo can hunt even wild boars and roe deer. Jindos are renowned for their loyalty to family members and their attachment to their home. Jindos have often been known to travel long distances to return to their original owner. The Jindo has a fastidious nature and puppies are housebroken with little training. Jindos also keep their coats extremely clean. Jindos are, by nature, watchful of other dogs and may, on their own territory, react aggressively to intruding dogs. Jindos are highly intelligent but because of their independent nature, respond best to positive reinforcement training, and preferably from their owner. While the Jindo is devoted to its owner, they are aloof and suspicious toward strangers.\n",

Honorable scars or other evidences of injury resulting from working in the field are not to be penalized.\nThe Karelian Bear Dog has a reserved but stable temperament and is very devoted to its master.

Has a broad head with prick ears inclined forward that are on the smaller side. Tail curls over the back. There is fringing on the tail and cheeks. It has a close resemblance to the Shiba Inu, Akita Inu and Ainu Dog.\nKishu Kens are a one person/one family dog. They are courageous and brave as hunters, and will be loyal to their owners. They have a strong prey drive, and will hunt small animals. A few have been known to do well with cats if raised with them. They do well with other dogs if socialized well as puppies, however, due to their pack instincts they might cause some fights for dominance. They are quite headstrong and willful, making training necessary, but they are devoted and loyal to family, getting along well with children, if raised with them. Kishu Kens like to keep an eye on whatever is going on, and sometimes find a high place to look out from. They can be aloof or shy around strangers.

Originally bred in Holland as a duck decoy dog, its heavily white plumed tail waves jauntily to entice and lure ducks to follow it into Eendenkooi (duck cages). When not working the traps, Kooikers were expected to work on the farm to catch vermin. The preferred height at the withers is 15 to 17 inches for males and 14 to 16 inches for females. The proportion of the Kooiker is off-square. The bone and substance of the Kooiker is moderate. The head should be in proportion to the dog. The expression is gentle and alert. Ears should be red in color and well feathered and ideally adorned with earrings. The color for the Kooiker should be predominately orange-red and may be patched or solid on pure white although a few small spots on the legs are acceptable. A black tail ring where the color changes from orange-red to white is permitted.\nCheerful, good natured, friendly, quiet, well-behaved, and alert; those are terms that are used to describe the Kooikerhondje. Depending on its domestic environment,[1]it is kind, happy and lively. They are also intelligent, attentive and more than willing to please their owner. The Kooikerhondje adapts to situations rather quickly, changing his behavior from quiet to lively when the situation allows him to be. He will not always immediately like strangers, instead choosing to retreat. But once he warms up to someone, the trust will be there for the rest of his life. The Kooikerhondje can make a fine apartment dog if exercised regularly, but a fenced yard will be more ideal. He has a medium energy level, yet is usually quiet when indoors.\n",

In the north of Queensland and New South Wales they are tall, medium boned and agile, bred for mustering Simmental cattle and Brahma over many miles. In The Hunter Valley region and Snowy Mountains of New South Wales, they're thicker set and shorter to flush low lying cattle from the dense bush and gullies. In Victoria, one finds the smallest variety of the Koolie. Koolies are bred to meet the needs of the stockman, grazier and farmer, all agile, all with the same ability to adapt to any situation, all with a strong willingness drive. The Koolie vary from 40 to 60 centimetres (16 to 24 in) in size and are a contrast of coat, colour and body type, although they are merled coat pattern. The solid red or black Koolie are often mistaken for Kelpies, and some bi coloured Koolie have been taken for Border Collies by the general public, rarely if ever by breeders. As all of these breeds share Collie ancestry, they resemble each other.\nGraziers, stockmen and dairy farmers across Australia since days long past have typically selected breeds which display the abilities required to meet their working needs. The temperament found in a Koolie is a culmination of these much sought-after abilities. The optimal worker possesses a combination of working skills and bonding temperament. Owners will be rewarded through the Koolie's diligence in varied roles such as in work situations, sporting activities, loyal service or the time honoured role of companionship. Known to be patient, temperate, dedicated, with a strong sense of willingness and devotion; the Koolie is not naturally aggressive but can demonstrate dominance. They show an untiring enthusiasm for work and an admirable hardiness when the job or circumstance requires.\n",

The color is brown/tan/buff markings on a white background with a blaze on the face 'as symmetrical as possible.'\nThe Kromfohrländer is a very lively, good-natured, intelligent breed with a comparatively weak hunting instinct, loves to play and run and can adapt to many situations fairly well. Kromfohrländers are very much \"people dogs\" and they rarely stray very far from their owner. They take to strangers and children rather hesitantly at first, but once they get familiar, they are friends for life.\n",

Teeth: scissor-bite, dentition perfect. The iron grey color has two additional shades, toward silver grey or very dark grey. Some of the darker animals have characteristic stripes on the legs, a reminder of their ancestry.\nThe breed standard describes the dog as having a sharp temperament and strong individuality, distrustful of strangers. It's a good guard dog. Like all large dogs, the Karst Shepherd needs to be well socialized while very young, with people if the dog is to be a companion, and with livestock if the dog is to be a guardian.

It is usually very playful and active around trusted humans or animals, but tends to stay cautious and alert around strangers. Its acute hearing makes it a decent watchdog.

The length of body is equal to or only slightly longer than the height at the withers, and the distance from the elbows to the ground is equal to one-half the height at the withers. Balance, outline, intelligence, temperament and movement are of overriding importance. The Labrador Retriever is a breed of moderation, thoroughly sound, and willing and able to do its work. The Labrador Retriever is a dog without exaggeration, so light, weedy dogs; long, low-stationed dogs; and cloddy, lumbering dogs are to be equally penalized. The Labrador Retriever should be evaluated as a working gun dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.\nThe Labrador Retriever is an enthusiastic hunter with a good nose and a soft mouth. They excel in all performance activities. Another essential characteristic of the Labrador Retriever is the short, dense, double coat that protects the dog when retrieving from water. The short, “otter” tail is another distinctive feature of this breed. Labrador Retrievers are noted for their excellent temperaments. This breed is friendly, outgoing and eager to please.

        "detail": "The ancestor of the Labrador Retriever was the St. John’s Retriever, a smaller version of the Newfoundland. These dogs were brought to England, probably on fishing boats. Gamekeepers crossed these Canadian imports with various breeds of gun dogs, always striving to improve the breed’s hunting and retrieving instincts. By the middle of the 19th century, the Labrador’s characteristic water-resistant coat and otter tail were already apparent. By the late 1880s, the breed was sufficiently distinctive that “Labrador Retriever” became the generally accepted name of the breed. Originally black in color, the first recorded yellow Labrador appeared in a litter born in 1899. Chocolates were also recorded at about the same time, but never achieved the same level of popularity as the blacks and yellows. Originally bred to retrieve from water, the modern Labrador Retriever has proven to be one of the most versatile breeds, excelling in hunt tests and field trials, in obedience and agility events, and also as service dogs.\n",

Their water friendly coat is very thick and curly. Solid colors include off-white, golden, or brown. They can also be found white with brown or orange patches or roan. It is a medium to large sized dog that is hypoallergenic, which also means it almost never sheds. A Lagotto often displays white markings that grow out in adult status.\nThe Lagotto is made to work. They generally have sharp senses, though their eyesight is more sensitive to motion than detail. They are very loyal and loving, making them the perfect family companion. Some are easy to train, and many get along with other animals quite easily if they're socialized as puppies.  Some Lagotti are excellent swimmers, but some will only paddle. Some will retrieve from lakes, streams and other bodies of water without hesitation. They are lovable family pets and tend to like attention. Lagotti love to dig; many owners give them a sandbox, or have a designated place to allow them satisfy their digging urges. They also love to play seeking games and have very active, and clever minds.\n",

Its body is deep and narrow, allowing it to squeeze through small passages after its quarry. Its expression reflects its mood, ranging from intense to gay or impish. Its double coat consists of a soft undercoat and a hard, wiry outer coat.\nThe spunky Lakeland makes the most of every day, always busy investigating, playing and, if it really gets its wish, hunting, running and chasing. Given daily exercise in a safe area, it settles down in the home and makes an entertaining and endearing house pet. It is reserved with strangers and usually aggressive toward other dogs and small animals. Clever, independent and stubborn, it can be mischievous. It is nonetheless sensitive and must be trained with patience as well as a sense of humor.\n",

The breed's smaller size has moved it from the realm of sled dog, but it remains a sled dog in miniature. Its trot is agile and bold. The expression is keen and alert.\nThe American Eskimo is bright, eager to please, lively and fun-loving — in short, an enjoyable and generally obedient companion. True to its spitz heritage, it is independent and tenacious and loves to run, especially in cold weather. But it is among the most biddable of spitz breeds, and it is calm and well-mannered inside.

The length of body is just slightly longer than tall, but bitches may be somewhat longer in body than dogs. The length of the front leg (measured from point of elbow to the ground) is approximately equal to one-half of the dog’s height at the withers. The head is powerful with a broad, slightly domed skull and a powerful muzzle that is slightly higher at the nose than the stop, when viewed in profile. Ears may be cropped, or hang naturally, close to the skull. The Dogo Argentino should be evaluated as a hunting dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.\nThe Dogo is an intelligent and courageous dog with a strong, natural instinct to protect its home and family. Dogos are very social dogs and are happiest when included in all family activities. Dogos make a strong distinction between familiar people and strangers, so it is imperative that they be well trained and socialized at an early age. Dogos are hunters of great courage and endurance, and will work individually or in packs. They have also successfully been used in police protection work. An unsteady temperament is a serious fault.\n",

Its confidence, hunting instinct, keen nose and loud voice also are of significant aid in hunting underground. Agility, freedom of movement and endurance are necessary for the dachshund's work, and its gait is fluid and smooth. The dachshund has an energetic, pleasant expression. Each of the three coat varieties has special attributes: The smooth is short and shining, imparting some protection against the elements; the longhair is sleek, sometimes slightly wavy, providing somewhat more protection; the wire has tight, thick and hard hair with a finer undercoat, providing maximal protection.\nThe dachshund is bold, curious and always up for adventure. It likes to hunt and dig, tracking by scent and going to ground after game. It is independent but will join in its family's activities whenever given a chance. It is good with children in its own family, but some may snap at strange children. Most are reserved with strangers. Some bark. The longhaired variety may be quieter and less terrier-like; the wires may be more outgoing. Some miniatures are more prone to be timid.\n",

The Dachshund was recognized as a distinct breed in 1910 and has gradually increased in popularity to become a favored pet. Famous Dachshunds include Picasso’s dog Lump, who may have inspired some of his works, and Waldi, the first Olympic Mascot and symbol of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany.\n",

The stand-off, double coat resists soaking and provides insulation against the cold. The small thick ears are also cold-resistant. The breed's smaller size has moved it from the realm of sled dog, but it remains a sled dog in miniature. Its trot is agile and bold. The expression is keen and alert.\nThe American Eskimo is bright, eager to please, lively and fun-loving — in short, an enjoyable and generally obedient companion. True to its spitz heritage, it is independent and tenacious and loves to run, especially in cold weather. But it is among the most biddable of spitz breeds, and it is calm and well-mannered inside. It is good with children, other dogs, and pets and is generally outgoing to everyone.\n",

The length of body is just slightly longer than tall, but bitches may be somewhat longer in body than dogs. The length of the front leg (measured from point of elbow to the ground) is approximately equal to one-half of the dog’s height at the withers. The head is powerful with a broad, slightly domed skull and a powerful muzzle that is slightly higher at the nose than the stop, when viewed in profile. Ears may be cropped, or hang naturally, close to the skull. The Dogo Argentino should be evaluated as a hunting dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.\nThe Dogo is an intelligent and courageous dog with a strong, natural instinct to protect its home and family. Dogos are very social dogs and are happiest when included in all family activities. Dogos make a strong distinction between familiar people and strangers, so it is imperative that they be well trained and socialized at an early age. Dogos are hunters of great courage and endurance, and will work individually or in packs. They have also successfully been used in police protection work. An unsteady temperament is a serious fault.\n",

Agility, freedom of movement and endurance are necessary for the dachshund's work, and its gait is fluid and smooth. The dachshund has an energetic, pleasant expression. Each of the three coat varieties has special attributes: The smooth is short and shining, imparting some protection against the elements; the longhair is sleek, sometimes slightly wavy, providing somewhat more protection; the wire has tight, thick and hard hair with a finer undercoat, providing maximal protection.\nThe dachshund is bold, curious and always up for adventure. It likes to hunt and dig, tracking by scent and going to ground after game. It is independent but will join in its family's activities whenever given a chance. It is good with children in its own family, but some may snap at strange children. Most are reserved with strangers. Some bark. The longhaired variety may be quieter and less terrier-like; the wires may be more outgoing. Some miniatures are more prone to be timid.\n",

The Dachshund was recognized as a distinct breed in 1910 and has gradually increased in popularity to become a favored pet. Famous Dachshunds include Picasso’s dog Lump, who may have inspired some of his works, and Waldi, the first Olympic Mascot and symbol of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany.\n",

The stand-off, double coat resists soaking and provides insulation against the cold. The small thick ears are also cold-resistant. The breed's smaller size has moved it from the realm of sled dog, but it remains a sled dog in miniature. Its trot is agile and bold. The expression is keen and alert.\nThe American Eskimo is bright, eager to please, lively and fun-loving — in short, an enjoyable and generally obedient companion. True to its spitz heritage, it is independent and tenacious and loves to run, especially in cold weather. But it is among the most biddable of spitz breeds, and it is calm and well-mannered inside. It is good with children, other dogs, and pets and is generally outgoing to everyone.\n",

The length of body is just slightly longer than tall, but bitches may be somewhat longer in body than dogs. The length of the front leg (measured from point of elbow to the ground) is approximately equal to one-half of the dog’s height at the withers. The head is powerful with a broad, slightly domed skull and a powerful muzzle that is slightly higher at the nose than the stop, when viewed in profile. Ears may be cropped, or hang naturally, close to the skull. The Dogo Argentino should be evaluated as a hunting dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.\nThe Dogo is an intelligent and courageous dog with a strong, natural instinct to protect its home and family. Dogos are very social dogs and are happiest when included in all family activities. Dogos make a strong distinction between familiar people and strangers, so it is imperative that they be well trained and socialized at an early age. Dogos are hunters of great courage and endurance, and will work individually or in packs. They have also successfully been used in police protection work. An unsteady temperament is a serious fault.\n",

Its confidence, hunting instinct, keen nose and loud voice also are of significant aid in hunting underground. Agility, freedom of movement and endurance are necessary for the dachshund's work, and its gait is fluid and smooth. The dachshund has an energetic, pleasant expression. Each of the three coat varieties has special attributes: The smooth is short and shining, imparting some protection against the elements; the longhair is sleek, sometimes slightly wavy, providing somewhat more protection; the wire has tight, thick and hard hair with a finer undercoat, providing maximal protection.\nThe dachshund is bold, curious and always up for adventure. It likes to hunt and dig, tracking by scent and going to ground after game. It is independent but will join in its family's activities whenever given a chance. It is good with children in its own family, but some may snap at strange children. Most are reserved with strangers. Some bark. The longhaired variety may be quieter and less terrier-like; the wires may be more outgoing. Some miniatures are more prone to be timid.\n",

The Dachshund was recognized as a distinct breed in 1910 and has gradually increased in popularity to become a favored pet. Famous Dachshunds include Picasso’s dog Lump, who may have inspired some of his works, and Waldi, the first Olympic Mascot and symbol of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany.\n",

True to its spitz heritage, it is independent and tenacious and loves to run, especially in cold weather. But it is among the most biddable of spitz breeds, and it is calm and well-mannered inside.

The length of body is just slightly longer than tall, but bitches may be somewhat longer in body than dogs. The length of the front leg (measured from point of elbow to the ground) is approximately equal to one-half of the dog’s height at the withers. The head is powerful with a broad, slightly domed skull and a powerful muzzle that is slightly higher at the nose than the stop, when viewed in profile. Ears may be cropped, or hang naturally, close to the skull. The Dogo Argentino should be evaluated as a hunting dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.\nThe Dogo is an intelligent and courageous dog with a strong, natural instinct to protect its home and family. Dogos are very social dogs and are happiest when included in all family activities. Dogos make a strong distinction between familiar people and strangers, so it is imperative that they be well trained and socialized at an early age. Dogos are hunters of great courage and endurance, and will work individually or in packs. They have also successfully been used in police protection work. An unsteady temperament is a serious fault.\n",

Its confidence, hunting instinct, keen nose and loud voice also are of significant aid in hunting underground. Agility, freedom of movement and endurance are necessary for the dachshund's work, and its gait is fluid and smooth. The dachshund has an energetic, pleasant expression. Each of the three coat varieties has special attributes: The smooth is short and shining, imparting some protection against the elements; the longhair is sleek, sometimes slightly wavy, providing somewhat more protection; the wire has tight, thick and hard hair with a finer undercoat, providing maximal protection.\nThe dachshund is bold, curious and always up for adventure. It likes to hunt and dig, tracking by scent and going to ground after game. It is independent but will join in its family's activities whenever given a chance. It is good with children in its own family, but some may snap at strange children. Most are reserved with strangers. Some bark. The longhaired variety may be quieter and less terrier-like; the wires may be more outgoing. Some miniatures are more prone to be timid.\n",

The Dachshund was recognized as a distinct breed in 1910 and has gradually increased in popularity to become a favored pet. Famous Dachshunds include Picasso’s dog Lump, who may have inspired some of his works, and Waldi, the first Olympic Mascot and symbol of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany.\n",

The length of body is just slightly longer than tall, but bitches may be somewhat longer in body than dogs. The length of the front leg (measured from point of elbow to the ground) is approximately equal to one-half of the dog’s height at the withers. The head is powerful with a broad, slightly domed skull and a powerful muzzle that is slightly higher at the nose than the stop, when viewed in profile. Ears may be cropped, or hang naturally, close to the skull. The Dogo Argentino should be evaluated as a hunting dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.\nThe Dogo is an intelligent and courageous dog with a strong, natural instinct to protect its home and family. Dogos are very social dogs and are happiest when included in all family activities. Dogos make a strong distinction between familiar people and strangers, so it is imperative that they be well trained and socialized at an early age. Dogos are hunters of great courage and endurance, and will work individually or in packs. They have also successfully been used in police protection work. An unsteady temperament is a serious fault.\n",

Its confidence, hunting instinct, keen nose and loud voice also are of significant aid in hunting underground. Agility, freedom of movement and endurance are necessary for the dachshund's work, and its gait is fluid and smooth. The dachshund has an energetic, pleasant expression. Each of the three coat varieties has special attributes: The smooth is short and shining, imparting some protection against the elements; the longhair is sleek, sometimes slightly wavy, providing somewhat more protection; the wire has tight, thick and hard hair with a finer undercoat, providing maximal protection.\nThe dachshund is bold, curious and always up for adventure. It likes to hunt and dig, tracking by scent and going to ground after game. It is independent but will join in its family's activities whenever given a chance. It is good with children in its own family, but some may snap at strange children. Most are reserved with strangers. Some bark. The longhaired variety may be quieter and less terrier-like; the wires may be more outgoing. Some miniatures are more prone to be timid.\n",

The Dachshund was recognized as a distinct breed in 1910 and has gradually increased in popularity to become a favored pet. Famous Dachshunds include Picasso’s dog Lump, who may have inspired some of his works, and Waldi, the first Olympic Mascot and symbol of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany.\n",

The tail hangs down.\nThe Landseer Newfoundland dog is known for its sweet disposition, gentleness, and serenity. They enjoy swimming and tend to drool, though not as much as some other giant breeds.

A latter-day Norfolk Terrier mated with a latter-day Sealyham Terrier does not produce a Lucas Terrier because it will not trace back to the original Lucas Terrier lines. All true Lucas Terriers have a direct connection to Sir Jocelyn Lucas's original Ilmer Kennel based Lucas Terriers. The Lucas Terrier is bred primarily for temperament and companionship, and so should be friendly, with no aggressive tendencies towards people or other dogs, and not fearful or nervous while retaining the usual terrier traits. The coat should be fairly harsh, weather resistant and of medium length. It may be coloured or white, but the majority are tan, black and tan or saddle and tan. Dogs should weigh 14–20 lbs (6–9 kg) and bitches 11–17 lbs (5–8 kg).\nThe Lucas Terrier is a small, sweet, non-exaggerated British terrier that is making a comeback in popularity in the U.S. Smart and easy to train. Friendly toward people and other dogs. Excellent with children. Eagar to please. Not a yapper by nature. Likes to dig. Make sure you are this dog's firm, confident, consistent pack leader to avoid Small Dog Syndrome, human induced behavior problems. Always remember, dogs are canines, not humans. Be sure to meet their natural instincts as animals.\n",

There is also a longhaired variety.\nTemperament is also variable, again dependent on parental influence. As could be expected, lurchers with dominant sighthound attributes have similar temperaments—often fairly lazy with a good eye—however, accordingly, others are influenced by their other, often more tractable, biddable, and slower parent.

Its gait displays good reach and drive. Its coat is double, with a close undercoat, and hard, wiry, outer coat which is longer on the legs, muzzle and eyebrows. Its facial furnishings add to its keen expression.\nThe miniature schnauzer deserves its place as one of the most popular terrier pets. It is playful, inquisitive, alert, spunky and companionable. It is a well-mannered house dog that also enjoys being in the middle of activities. It is less domineering than the larger schnauzers and less dog-aggressive than most terriers. It is also better with other animals than most terriers, although it will gladly give chase. It is clever and can be stubborn, but it is generally biddable. It enjoys children. Some may bark a lot.\n",

During the years around the turn of the century, both smooth German Pinscher and coarse-haired Schnauzer pups appeared in the same litters. The German Pinscher Schnauzer Club initiated a policy requiring proof of three generations of pure coarse-haired Schnauzer coats for registration. This quickly helped set type and made them a distinct breed from the German Pinscher. These Schnauzers were given the name Standard Schnauzer. Miniature Schnauzers were developed by crossing small Standard Schnauzers with the Affenpinscher and possibly the Poodle. The Schnauzer name derived from the German word \"Schnauze,\" which means \"muzzle.\" It was used as a ratter and still retains the ability, but is mostly a companion dog today. Some of the Schnauzer's talents include: hunting, tracking, ratter, watchdog, competitive obedience and performing tricks.\n",

It is a vigorous dog, with a jaunty, smooth, flowing gait.

It wears a keen and determined expression on its characteristic clown face.\nVery much like the larger bull terrier, the mini is comical, lively, playful and mischievous. Despite its smaller size, it is not a lap dog. It is every bit as tough as the larger version and apt to want to prove itself even more. It is a sweet clown, devoted but not fawning. It is stubborn and independent and needs to be trained with a firm yet gentle hand — and a good sense of humor. It likes to play and investigate. It likes to dig, and it needs ample exercise.\n",

The dog is medium sized with females standing 16-21 inches at the shoulder and weighing 30-50 pounds and males standing 18-25 inches at the shoulder and weighing 35-65 pounds. The dogs have a variety of ear sets from pricked ears to floppy ears and everything in between. Most McNabs are black or brown with white feet, white collars, white facial strips and white tipped tails, but tricolor McNabs are well known as well as mostly black McNabs. Some McNabs sport random white patches on their bodies and faces. Their eyes are set well apart, almond shaped, and brown, hazel, or copper colored with occasional marble flecked or powder blue eyes. The McNab coat is close, dense and weather resistant. They can have a slick single short coat, a short double coat, or a medium length single coat, but their fur is never long. One of the distinctive features of the McNab is their catlike feet which contribute to their agility.\nThe McNabs reputation as an indefatigable \"all-weather\" dog is also opening up a new avenue of work for the dog: Search and Rescue. Currently McNabs are working as evidence search dogs, cadaver dogs, archaeology dogs, and area search dogs for missing persons. Where many other breeds have to be pulled off the search because the dog is tiring, the only limitation for the McNab is the energy of its handler.\n",

The best way to determine the temperament of a mixed breed is to look up all breeds in the cross and know you can get any combination of any of the characteristics found in either breed. Not all of these designer hybrid dogs being bred are 50% purebred to 50% purebred. It is very common for breeders to breed multi-generation crosses.\nThe Mal-Shi is an intelligent, loyal, playful breed that requires moderate exercise and mental stimulation. Though quite independent, they are very eager to please and easily trained. They do well with older children, nearly all animals, and with those of whom they are accustomed. They are alert, agile and highly perceptive. They're not overly vocal and often fearful of strangers, making them a poor candidate for watchdog.\n",

Ears are set high and drop. The tail is straight, set low, and may be a natural bob. The coat is dense but close fitting. The Mountain Cur should be evaluated as a working dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work. Scars should neither be penalized nor regarded as proof of a dog’s working abilities.\nThe Mountain Cur is intelligent, easily trained, and neither vicious nor shy. They are known to always try to please their masters. They are not, however, dogs to be trifled with; historically many a cur died fighting to protect their family from attackers or dangerous predators. These curs were bred to work, and if deprived of the opportunity to hunt, guard, or work around a farm they will grow anxious and bored.

It is slightly longer than it is tall. Its gait gives the impression of effortless power, with good reach and drive. Its double coat consists of a soft, dense undercoat and a coarse, moderately long and straight outer coat. Its soft expression reflects its benevolent and dignified temperament.\nThe Newfoundland dog is known for its calm and docile nature and its strength. They are highly loyal and make ideal working dogs. It is for this reason that this breed is known as \"the gentle giant\". International kennel clubs generally describe the breed as having a sweet temper. It typically has a deep bark, and is easy to train if started young. They are wonderfully good with children, but small children can get accidentally leaned on and knocked down. Newfoundlands are ideal companions in the world of therapy and are often referred to as the nanny dog. The breed was memorialized in \"Nana\", the beloved guardian dog in J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan. The Newfoundland in general is good with other animals, but its size can cause problems if it is not trained.\n",

Their powerful yet compact build enables them to rush around tirelessly, leaping and retrieving with tail always wagging. The jaws are strong enough to carry a duck. Because they were bred to work in icy waters, they have a water-repelling double coat of medium length. A longer coat is not appropriate for a working dog, although the tail feathering should be long, adding to the emphasis of the wagging tail. A white blazeon the face, chest, tail tip or feet is characteristic, and may serve to make the dog's gamboling more noticeable to distant ducks.\nAs befitting a dog bred to play and retrieve tirelessly, the Toller is very energetic and playful. You cannot throw a ball just once for a Toller! Everything they do is done with gusto, whether it's hunting, obedience, agility or just walking around the block. They are alert but not hyperactive, and can adjust to many circumstances. They are affectionate and gentle, but young Tollers can be overly boisterous at times. They are good with children, other dogs and pets. Tollers may be initially wary of strangers, but warm up quickly. They learn fast and are generally willing to please, but bore easily and then can be a bit stubborn.\n",

It is constructed for agility and endurance, rather than speed, enabling it to trail for hours and then hold big game at bay by barking and dodging attack. Its trot is effortless. It has a thick, smooth-lying coat consisting of straight outer hairs and a wooly undercoat. This combination presents the best protection against cold and snow.\nThe Norwegian elkhound combines traits of hounds and spitz-like dogs, resulting in a breed that is bold, playful, independent, alert, boisterous and — unlike most hounds — even protective. This is a dog ready for adventure and happiest if that adventure takes place outdoors in cold weather. It needs daily exercise, lest it become frustrated or even destructive. It is friendly with strangers but may quarrel with strange dogs. It tends to pull when on leash unless trained, and it may bark a lot.\n",

The tail should be long enough to grasp firmly, so that the dog can be pulled from a hole. The double coat has a hard, wiry and straight outer coat that lies close to the body and is thicker around the mane for protection. The dog bears a slightly foxy expression.\nThe Norwich terrier, like the Norfolk, is a true terrier at heart, always ready for adventure and excitement. It is a hunter and may chase small animals. It is a pert, independent, amusing — but sometimes challenging — companion, best suited for people with a sense of adventure and humor.\n",

However, when forced to act, the Neo can spring into action with surprising speed. Its massive muscular body can knock down almost any intruder. Its huge head with short, powerful jaws and large teeth can crush or hold an opponent. The skin is tough and hanging, adding to the imposing impression of size as well as formidable expression.\nThe Neapolitan Mastiff was bred for centuries to guard its family. As such, it is incredibly loyal and devoted to its family, watchful and suspicious of strangers, and tolerant of acquaintances. It is a stay-at-home-type dog. Although it is loving toward children, its sheer size can make accidents possible. It may not get along well with other dogs, especially domineering-type dogs. Because of its size, it should be carefully socialized at an early age.\n",

Features such as six toes on each foot; prick ears that fold closed, forward or backward at will; and the ability to tip the head backward until it touches the back bone all helped them perform their job as Puffin hunter. Their dense coat ranges from fallow to reddish brown to tan in color, with black hair tips and white markings, or white with red or dark markings.\nTheir superior personality, even disposition and small size make them an ideal, easy-to-live-with pet, although they may be wary of strangers. Consistency in the home environment is extremely important, as is consistency in training, house training, and socialization. Lundehund is very sensitive and can develop trust issues with an owner who tries to trick him into doing things - you can only fool a Lundehund once. They are incredibly clever and fun-loving, making them delightful and sometimes challenging.\n",

If properly socialized, it can be tame enough to tolerate the handling of humans, getting attached to its owners.\nThe New Guinea Singing Dog, also known as Hallstrom’s dog, is named for its distinctive and melodious howl, which is characterized by a sharp increase in pitch at the start and very high frequencies at the end. NGSDs are active, lively, and alert. They are constantly exploring everything in their environment, using all five senses, including taste. Their incredible structural flexibility allows them to pass their bodies through any opening wide enough to admit their head. Their hunting drive is very intense and may overwhelm any training when prey is detected. They use their acute sense of hearing in addition to sight and scent to locate prey. Although gentle and affectionate with people they know, they can be aloof with strangers. NGSDs can be aggressive toward other dogs, especially of the same sex. Its howl has an eerie yet synchronized quality, which gives the breed its name. The howl can be spurred when the dog is disturbed or excited. One tone blends with the next, sending goose bumps up a listener's back. Opera singers have expressed a particular interest in this vocally skillful canine. This is a hardy and well-balanced dog. The Singing Dog is similar to the Dingo, although smaller than its near relative.\n",

The dog should have a double coat and a straight tail – curly tails are considered a fault.\nThe Northern Inuit dog is not for the novice owner as they can be very stubborn and are very quick-witted. The owner of a Northern Inuit must show themselves to be a strong leader or be prepared to be the underdog, and be taken advantage of. They are more difficult to train than other, more biddable breeds. Separation anxiety may arise when they are left alone and unsupervised too long, leading to destructive behaviours but training to be left from a young age will rectify this. Training from the onset is a must for this breed. Often, they will do better with another dog for company. Socialization should begin when vaccinated and throughout as their play can be very rough and misinterpreted.\n",

A distinguishing characteristic is the top-line, which is lower at the withers than the loin. Its gait is free, powerful and ground-covering, yet gives the appearance of being effortless. This breed may pace or amble at slower speeds. Its ambling gait is sometimes described as a \"bearlike\" roll or shuffle. The coat is profuse, but not excessive. It consists of a waterproof undercoat and a hard, shaggy outer coat that is neither straight nor curly. The expression is intelligent. The bobtail's bark should be loud, with a \"pot-casse\" ring to it.\nThe breed standards describe the ideal Old English Sheepdog as never being nervous or aggressive. The New Zealand Kennel Club adds that \"they are sometimes couch potatoes\" and \"may even try to herd children by gently bumping them.\" This breed's temperament can be described as intelligent, social and adaptable. The American Kennel Club adds that the breed has \"a clownish energy\" and \"may try to herd people or other objects.\" With wide open spaces being the ideal setting for an Old English Sheepdog, the breed is a natural fit in a rural setting, such as working on a farm; although, with proper exercise and training, they are perfectly comfortable with a suburban or urban lifestyle. Their remarkable, inherent herding instincts, sense of duty, and sense of property boundaries may be nurtured and encouraged accordingly, or subdued by their owners. Old English Sheepdogs should not be deprived of the company and the warmth of people.\n",

Its coat, which consists of a rough, coarse outer coat combined with a soft wooly slightly oily undercoat, is essential for protecting it from brambles and cold water. It has a fairly large nose and muzzle, allowing ample room for olfactory receptors. Its large feet provide traction over rough and slippery terrain. This is a strong athletic breed that can withstand harsh weather and long strenuous hunts. Its expression is open and amiable, reflecting its temperament. The otterhound is noted for its steadfast pursuit of its quarry despite the roughest of conditions. It has an acute sense of smell and can trail unerringly through running water and over all sorts of terrain.\nAs a pack hound, the otterhound is amiable with other dogs. As a hunter, it has an innate urge to follow the trails of mammals. Once on the trail, it is determined, single-minded and nearly impossible to dissuade from its task. Even though the otterhound's job was not to kill its quarry, it will nonetheless give chase to small animals. The otterhound loves to hunt, sniff, trail and, especially, swim. At home it is boisterous, amiable and easygoing (although stubborn), affectionate with its family, and quite good with children. Because the otterhound was never traditionally kept as a pet, it is not among the most responsive of breeds. However, the otterhound is a low-key dog that can function as a quiet companion.\n",

The ears are long, drop, and densely feathered. The tail is normally docked, set high, and carried erect. The length of body (sternum to point of buttocks) is equal to the height (withers to ground). The Standard Poodle carries himself with an air of dignity and pride. The Standard Poodle should be evaluated as a working gun dog and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.\nThe Standard Poodle’s most readily identifiable characteristic is its harsh, dense coat, which is presented in various traditional trims or, less frequently, corded. Another essential characteristic is proper temperament. The breed is noted for its high intelligence, trainability and sense of humor. Poodles are highly social and require human companionship and regular, close interaction with family members. Because of their great intelligence and the joy they take in human companionship, Poodles excel in performance events of all sorts. They are extremely affectionate with children.\n",

The German variety has probably influenced the modern breed most (‘Poodle’ is German for ‘splash’ or ‘puddle’). In 18th and 19th century Europe, the Poodle served a wide variety of purposes, including duck hunting, guiding, and later circus performing, from whence the modern grooming style likely arose. The Poodle became a popular pet for the French aristocracy, and in time was officially adopted as the national dog. Poodles were imported to America in the 20th century. They slowly rose in popularity and eventually became the country’s most popular dog. The poodle is a group of formal dog breeds, the Standard Poodle, Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle. The origins of the poodles are still discussed with a dispute over whether the poodle descends from the old French Barbet breed or from Germany as a type of water dog.\n",

It is the smallest herding breed. ‘Cor gi’ translates to ‘dwarf dog’ or ‘gathering dog’ in Welsh; the rest of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi’s name comes from its birthplace of Pembrokeshire, Wales. Originally used as a hunter and guard dog, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi was later trained to herd cattle and sheep. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi was not used as a show dog until the 1920’s, and then met with only mild success. It was recognized as a distinct breed from the Cardigan Welsh Corgi in 1934, which led to a gradual increase in popularity. By 2006 the Pembroke Welsh Corgi had become the 22nd most registered breed with the American Kennel Club, far outnumbering the Cardigan variety. Famous Pembroke Welsh Corgis include ‘Ein’, the genius dog from anime ‘Cowboy Bebop’, and Stephen King's Pembroke Welsh Corgi ‘Marlowe’, who ‘Oy’ from ‘The Dark Tower’ series is based on. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is also highly popular with British royalty; Queen Elizabeth II reportedly has more than a dozen pet Pembrokes.\n",

The soft thick undercoat combined with the longer harsh outer coat, standing off from the body, combine to give the dog a unique puffy appearance. This look is further accentuated by the thick ruff and a head carriage that is naturally up-gazing.\nBouncy, bold and busy, the Pomeranian makes the most of every day. It is curious, playful, self-confident (even cocky) and attentive, ever ready for a game or adventure. It is reserved toward strangers. Some can be aggressive toward other dogs. Some bark a lot.\n",

Pugs are strong willed but rarely aggressive, and are suitable for families with children. The majority of the breed is very fond of children and sturdy enough to properly play with them. Depending on their owner's mood, they can be quiet and docile but also vivacious and teasing. Pugs tend to be intuitive and sensitive to the moods of their owners and are usually eager to please them. Pugs tend to have a somewhat lazy nature and spend a lot of time napping.

Its gait is dignified and unhurried, with a slight roll resulting from its wider, heavier forequarters. It has a thick undercoat, and its outer coat is long, coarse and straight, and stands off. It forms a mane around the shoulders. The Pekingese must suggest its Chinese origins in its lionlike appearance, bold and direct character, and distinctive expression.\nThe Pekingese is decidedly not a sissy lap dog. It is a courageous character that will not start a fight but will not back down from one either. It tends to be aloof around strangers. It is extremely devoted to its family, but it is independent and not overly demonstrative. Its stubbornness is legendary.

The gait is smooth and powerful, with head held high and nostrils wide, enabling it to cover a lot of ground while searching for airborne scent. The tail lashes from side to side when the dog gaits. The pointer's close coat is short and dense, giving a clean streamlined appearance. field type pointers tend to hold their tails upright when on point.\nThe pointer is a true wide-ranging hunter, which means that it not only is an excellent bird dog but also has the stamina to run for hours. Consequently, it needs lots of exercise or it can become frustrated and destructive. Because it is ever on the lookout for birds, it is easily distracted from everyday matters — but it is nearly impossible to distract once on point. It is gentle and sweet but may be too energetic and boisterous at times for very small children. Like many sporting breeds, it can be found in field or show types; the field type is generally smaller and perhaps more active.\n",

Its slender build allows it to fit into small passageways in pursuit of its quarry. Spanning is a critical part of judging the Parson. The chest behind the elbows must be easily spanned by average-size hands, such that the thumbs should meet at the spine and the fingers under the chest. Its gait is free and lively, with good reach and drive. Its coat can be either smooth or broken, both coarse and weatherproof with a short, dense undercoat. The outercoat of the smooth is flat and hard; that of the broken is harsh, straight, tight and close lying, with no sculpted furnishings. The PRT's expression is keen and full of life.\nThis is a dog that thrives on action and adventure. In the process, it often finds itself in the middle of trouble. It is a true hunter at heart, and will explore, wander, chase and dig when it gets a chance. It is very playful and intelligent. It gets along well with children and strangers. It can be scrappy with strange dogs, but is better than many terriers. It does well with horses, but it may chase cats and is not good with rodents. It may tend to bark and dig. It makes an ideal companion for an active person with a good sense of humor who wants a lot of entertainment — and mischief —in one dog.\n",

The smooth coat is short and very dense, while the wire coat (rough) is long and harsh, with a bearded muzzle. Preferred coat color is yellow or fawn, with or without white markings.\nPequenos earned their rep as tough, tireless hunting buddies of farmers and country squires, but they are also cherished as pets by Portuguese city dwellers. Their compact body, trainability, and agreeable personality make them ideal town dogs. Smart and versatile, Pequenos are athletes who can master any number of dog sports.

The gait is free, giving the appearance of a dog that is capable of a full day in the field. The tousled appearance results in part from its rough coat, with long facial furnishings. This, in combination with its thick, shorter undercoat, gives the PBGV ample protection against brambles and the elements. Its expression - alert and friendly - reflects its nature.\nDespite its appearance, the PBGV is not a basset hound in a wire coat, but in many ways is more terrier-like in temperament. It is a merry, inquisitive, tough, busy dog, always on the lookout for excitement and fun. It loves to sniff, explore, trail and dig ? a true hunter at heart. Amiable and playful, it is good with children, other dogs and pets, and it is friendly toward strangers. The PBGV is stubborn and independent. It tends to dig and bark.\n",

Having a secure, fenced-in yard is a very good idea. The PBGV like to dig and can be great escape artists. Watch for small holes and/or signs of interest along the fence line.

It is streamlined and agile, yet powerful with great endurance. The hair is short to medium in length, fine to medium coarse in texture. When trailing, the Plott is bold and confident, not backing down from a challenge. Its voice is open and unrestricted, with a loud bugle-like chop or bawl.\nBred for generations as a bear and coon dog, the Plott's first nature is to sniff up a cold trail and follow it to the end. Yet the Plott makes the transition to family dog with ease, being eager to please and loyal. This is an extremely courageous breed, and, as befitting any good hound, it can be headstrong. Plotts can be wary of strangers, but generally warm up quickly. They are not as gregarious with other dogs as some hounds, and true to their bear-hunting heritage, can be ferocious fighters if pushed. They may tree the family cat!\n",

Its large, mobile ears help it follow animals underground. Slightly longer than tall, the gait is free and flowing, with head held high. The coat is short and glossy.\nThe svelte pharaoh hound is more than a gracious addition to the home (though it surely is that) — it is a keen hunter and an exuberant chaser. Although it is calm indoors, it loves to run. It is sensitive, loving, gentle and good with children and other dogs, but it may chase strange animals. It tends to be reserved with strangers; some pharaoh hounds are even timid. It is independent but willing to please. The breed has the unique characteristic of \"blushing\" when excited, with the nose and ears turning a rosy color.\n",

The coat is long, dense, shaggy, and double, providing great protection against the elements. The PON is shown naturally, without scissoring.\nLively and loyal, the PON has been shaped by centuries of work as a shepherd. This is a territorial breed that is often wary of strangers; however, to those it knows it is very affectionate. A PON's bark is one of its best friends, and the typical PON shows it off often. The PON has an independent and even willful side. It learns quickly, but sees no use in following commands blindly. Despite its shaggy dog look, the PON can be a serious dog. PONs are good with considerate children, most other pets, and most other dogs, although if challenged by a dog, they will hold their own.\n",

Colors include shades of fawn from tan to copper, as well as charcoal to silver to pearl grey. Although tentative with strangers, the Pyrenean Shepherd has a very lively, cheerful disposition, and is a superb canine athlete who excels at agility and other dog sports.\nStill very close to their working roots, The Pyrenean Shepherd possess the traits of superior herding dogs: intelligence, independence, courage, vigor, and versatility. Keeping one cooped up and alone, with nothing to do, will not only lead to problem behaviors, it’s a waste of a remarkable animal. The Pyrenean Shepherd bonds intensely with their special person, sometimes to the exclusion of all others. Their alertness and a natural wariness of strangers make them excellent watchdogs. They do best with owners who can match their energy and devotion.\n",

Ears are set just above the line of the eye and may be cropped, naturally pendent or rose. The body of the Presa Canario is slightly longer than its height at the withers, with a broad, deep chest, but females may be slightly longer and possess somewhat less rib spring than the males. Skin is thick and elastic. The distance from the withers to the elbow is roughly equal to the distance from the elbow to the ground. The tail is very thick at the base, and tapers to a point. The tail is moderately high and reaches to the hock. The overall impression is that of an imposing, solid guard dog.\nThe essential characteristics of the Presa are those which enable it to drive and hold cattle, and to guard its home and family. These tasks require a powerful, agile, courageous dog with a large head and powerful jaws. The Presa is extremely affectionate, docile and well behaved with its owner and family, but is wary of strangers and aggressive with other dogs.\n",

The head is powerfully built and in males, the circumference of the skull should exceed the height of the dog. They have strong jaws with a very mild underbite, and widely spaced canines. The tail is set low, thick and is carried in a slight arch when the dog is moving.\nThis is an intelligent dog who needs an owner who can understand and handle it.

The hairless and the coated dogs are identical except for ear carriage, and they can be born in the same litter. The breed comes in many skin and coat color combinations.\nPeruvian Hairless dogs are affectionate with family but wary of strangers. They tend to be very protective of women and children in the family. They are typically lively, alert and friendly with other dogs. They are agile and fast, and many of them enjoy sight-hunting small rodents. These dogs do not like to be alone, but when trained, can do well. They tend to know their allowed territories and respect it. These dogs are intolerant of extreme temperatures, although they are quite comfortable wearing clothing and will even play in the snow if dressed warmly. They generally require an owner that understands dog language and are not recommended for beginners. They learn fast, and they are very smart, but get bored easily with repetitious games like \"fetch\".\n",

The breed is similar in size to the English Setter, although is slightly smaller. Of the Spaniel type breeds, only the Large Münsterländer and Drentse Patrijshond are recognised as possibly growing to larger sizes, with the Drentse measuring 21.5–25.5 in (55–65 cm), and the Münsterländer slightly smaller with a narrower range at 23–25 in (58–64 cm).\nThe Picardy Spaniel is a docile breed of dog and is fond of playing with children and bonds well with their master. It is described as having a gentle sociable nature, possessing a good character and being relatively easy to train. In France, the breed is used for hunting in wooded areas for Pheasants, and in swamps for Snipes. However it can also be used for hunting ducks, hares and rabbits. The breed excels at hunting in marshes and will not hesitate to jump into water. It can also adequately serve as a retriever should it be required. The dog is content with a small amount of space and could suit life in the city, but also loves open spaces.\n",

The body of the Portuguese Pointer is almost square. The Portuguese Pointer should be evaluated as a working gun dog and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.\nThe Portuguese Pointer has strong hunting instincts. In the field, the Portuguese Pointer is a tenacious hunter in all sorts of terrain and climate. The dog’s affectionate nature is so intense that the Portuguese standard describes it as “…occasionally even embarrassing”. This devotion, however, makes the Portuguese a joy in the field because no dog delights more in sharing the hunt with its master.\n",

It has a lean, delicate body, which is covered with thin skin. The neck is moderately long and narrow, supporting its delicate head. The muzzle is narrow and fox-like, with straight but crowded teeth. Its coat is short with very thin, glossy fur. Coat color is mostly black and tan. The Prazky Krysarik is 2 cm shorter in maximum height than the Miniature Pinscher is in minimum height.\nBest known for its active and lively nature, the Prague Ratter is a spunky breed that is full of original character. These tiny dogs thrive on strong and dependable relationships with humans, love to receive affection and play the role of lap dog during down time. This breed is highly intelligent and generally responds well to basic training and commands. As a pet, the Prague Ratter is obedient, loyal, loving, and very affectionate. The Prague Ratter adapts well to full-time indoor and apartment living, yet still enjoys spending time outdoors, playing games such as fetch, and taking long and leisurely walks. They are also known to be a very quiet dog unlike many other small dogs who tend to be very \"yappy\". Like any small dog one should be wary of allowing them to develop Small Dog Syndrome as they can become aggressive if they are not well-socialized from an early age.\n",

It is different from most sporting dog breeds in the USA and UK in its length, and the pointed quality of the muzzle.The Pont-Audemer Spaniel's coat is curly or, at the very least, quite wavy, but smooth around the face. The most common pattern is brown and white roan but a solid brown coat is also acceptable. Both coat patterns can have red-brown “dead leaf glints”. Black or tan markings are faults. The hair on the face is short. The topknot can take up to five years to fully develop. Most Pontos have docked tails. Tails that are left intact are usually well feathered like that of a setter, although it is not unheard of for a Ponto to have the shorthaired “rat-tail” of an Irish Water Spaniel.\nThough hardy, as well as hard-working, the breed has the typical spaniel traits of being easy to train, gentle, and affectionate. The dogs are known to have a fun-loving quality and in France are said to be le petit clown des marais (the little clown of the marshes). Pont-Audemer Spaniels are usually found in a working gundog environment, and are rarely kept as mere family pets. The dogs specialize as water dogs. At the start of the 20th century they were prized for their use in hunting wild ducks in either the water or marshy conditions. They remain used in France in various terrain, and used for hunting rabbits or pheasants.\n",

They are territorial, loyal and protective of their owners, and are very good watchdogs for this reason. They have a very loud bark and will bark at anything that is suspicious, as they are trying to protect their family. Since they were trained to be cautious and not attack until completely necessary when predators were around sheep, The Polish Tatra Sheepdog will not bite a stranger or other animals unless continuously provoked, leading them to be considered very dog and animal friendly.

As befitting its self-assured nature, it tends to be headstrong and stubborn and is often domineering. It is reserved, often wary, toward strangers. It may be overly protective if it perceives that its family is being threatened, and it may also attempt to \"herd\" children.

Because the lion is not the only quarry of the Ridgeback, the dog must also be strong enough to bring down other large game. Its stride is efficient and long. The short glossy coat is adapted for working in hot climates. A distinctive feature is the clearly defined ridge, which should start with two identical whorls just behind the shoulders and taper to a point between the hipbones.\nThe Rhodesian Ridgeback is the hound group's answer to a somewhat protective dog. Not only is it a keen and versatile hunter, but it is a loyal guardian. It is good with children, especially protective of those in its family, but it is sometimes overly boisterous in play for small children. It is strong-willed and powerful; some can become domineering. It is reserved with strangers and can be aggressive toward strange dogs and animals.\n",

Dogs of this size and type have the potential to be a danger to others if not well socialized at an early age, and are recommended only for the experienced dog handler who has the time to socialize and train the dog. This Mountain dog matures slowly, is very independent, and often does not respond to traditional force methods of dog obedience training.

The coat is short and fine. An extremely handsome and graceful dog, the Rajapalayam has a gait similar to the trotting of a thoroughbred horse.\nThe Rajapalayam was used predominantly for hunting wild boar and as a formidable guard dog.They are sight hounds by nature but it was proved that by a little training they can be also a Scent hound. All depends on the trainer. It needs wide open spaces and is very affectionate and devoted towards its owner, although not always demonstrative. They do not usually like to be touched or handled by strangers and are known to be one-person dogs. Rajapalayams are largely aggressive and hostile towards strangers, and will attack intruders. Socialization in puppyhood is important. They usually do not get along well with other pets like cats, owing to their strong hunting instincts.\n",

Physically it is similar to a Cocker Spaniel, but has a shorter, tighter coat and a longer body. Developed and used as hunting dogs, this breed does not suffer from any major health complaints other than those normally associated with spaniels. Popular in its native Russia, the breed was only introduced overseas in the 1990s, and is not yet recognised by any major kennel clubs.\nTo its owner, the Russian Spaniel is unparalleled in devotion and ability. It is amiable toward other dogs regardless of the breed. In addition to providing impressive work in the field, the Russian Spaniel makes a good-natured house pets and a reliable watchdog. Great with children, his handsome appearance and agreeable nature make him a good companion, and most are kept at home. Easy to train, the Russian Spaniel is devoted to his master, never letting him out of sight. The Russian Spaniel needs a firm, but calm, confident, consistent pack leader in order to be mentally stable.\n",

There are two types of coats in the breed: smooth coat and long coat. The smooth-coated variety was previously known as the Russian Toy Terrier and long-coated as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier. Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the \"Terrier\" was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the Fédération Cynologique Internationale[1] and has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008, allowed to compete in AKC companion events since 2010. The first official breed standard of the two varieties was written in 1966 in Russia.\nActive and cheerful, the Russian Toy was originally bred both as an anti-rat dog and a watch dog. The second quality is still active in the breed, and they can be very vocal. They can become quite attached to their family, regardless of the ages of the family members. Russian Toys are usually very reserved with strangers, but very loyal to their owners, always ready to protect them from any perceived danger.\n",

The breed is known for its soft, wavy to curly coat in a variety of colors. They have ears that are neither too long nor too short. Male Bolonkas have a distinct beard and moustache that sets them apart from their female counterparts. Bolonka tails are supposed to have the tip touching the back. Similar to other Bichon breeds, Bolonki do not shed. Daily brushing of the coat helps to prevent matting. If a Bolonka's coat gets severely matted, they may develop a hematoma. Bolonka dogs are considered suitable for people with allergies, as they are bred to be hypoallergenic. Breeds that don't shed are more likely to be hypoallergenic, since the dog's dander and saliva stick to the hair and are not released into the environment. The frequent trimming, brushing, and bathing required to keep the Bolonka looking its best removes hair and dander and controls saliva. It is important to note that how hypoallergenic a particular dog is for a particular person may vary with the individual dog and the individual person.\nThe Tsvetnaya Bolonka is even-tempered, intelligent, friendly to all, and should never be shy or show aggression of any kind. The Russian Tszvetnaya Bolonka was specifically developed as a companion dog and is prized for its sociable, easy-going and affectionate temperament. Its specimens will avoid exuberant games and won’t appreciate any extent of physical abuse during playing. The Bolonka Zwetna usually perceives all unfamiliar people as potential play mates and without timely socialization it can grow into an inappropriate greeter. However this breed was bred with strong tendency to defend its territory and its favorite humans, so it can become a fairly good watchdog. The Bolonka won’t be able to apply to necessary aggression when the situation calls for it and shouldn’t be tasked with the responsibilities of a guardian.\n",

This breed loves to run and will roam if given the chance. It may be aggressive toward strange dogs, but it is generally good with other household dogs.

It was imported to Alaska in the early 20th century during the Alaskan gold rush. The Siberian Husky attracted attention when it completely dominated native breeds in the 400 mile ‘All-Alaska Sweepstakes’ race from Nome to Candle in 1910, the second year in which it competed. It gained further prominence in 1925 when a gold miner named Leonhard Seppala used a now-famous team of Siberian Huskies to make an urgent delivery of diphtheria serum to Nome, saving thousands of lives. This delivery became known as the ‘Great Race of Mercy’ and attracted much attention to the Siberian Husky. A statue honoring Seppala’s team stands today in Central Park. In 1930, Russia allowed the last group of Siberian Huskies to be exported from Siberia; the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club that same year. Most Siberian Huskies today descend from the 1930 exports and Leonhard Seppala’s team. Today the Siberian Husky is one of the most popular northern breeds, serving as a pet, sled racing dog, and show dog.\n",

The Shih Tzu in its current form was primarily developed in China during the reign of Chinese Empress Dowager Cixi in the late 1800’s, likely from crosses of the Pekingese with the Lhasa Apso. The Shih Tzu was a favored pet of royalty, but fell into decline when British troops raided the Forbidden City in 1860. The breed survived, but was generally not distinguished from the Lhasa Apso until 1934, when the smaller, shorter nosed variety was reassigned its original Chinese name, ‘Shih Tzu’. The Shih Tzu was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1969 and has continued to climb in popularity to this day. Crossbreeds between Shih Tzu and other toy breeds are also increasing in popularity, particularly crosses with the Poodle and Bichon Frise.\n",

The gait is light, quick and agile, with an effortless, smooth stride. The double coat consists of a strong straight outer coat with a soft undercoat, imparting great insulation. These traits enabled the shiba to hunt small game through dense cover.\nBold, independent and headstrong, the shiba is brimming with self-confidence. It is lively outdoors, yet calm indoors, as long as it gets daily exercise. It may be aggressive with strange dogs of the same sex and may chase small animals. It is a hardy breed, ready for adventure. Some tend to be headstrong and domineering. It is territorial, alert and reserved with strangers — ingredients making for an excellent watchdog.

Its abundant, soft, single coat distinguishes it from all other terriers. It is long and silky with a gentle wave. The overall appearance is one of grace and strength in an alert and happy dog.\nThe Wheaten makes a playful companion at home and a fun-loving partner in the field. It is affectionate, congenial and much gentler than most terriers. It is generally responsive to its owner's wishes but can be headstrong at times. It is good with children (although some may be overly boisterous with small children) and usually good with other household dogs and pets. It may dig or jump.\n",

Its expression is animated, with the characteristic \"Samoyed smile\" created by the upturned corners of its mouth.\nGentle and playful, the Samoyed makes a good companion for a child or person of any age. It is a closely bonded family dog. It is amiable with strangers, other pets and usually, other dogs. It is calm indoors, but this clever, sometimes mischievous breed needs daily physical and mental exercise. If allowed to become bored, it will dig and bark.

Variety in the drills is key, as Samoyeds can get bored if asked to do the same task over and over and refuse to do anything. Screaming, shouting or hitting will not get the dog's respect, in fact it will produce the opposite effect. The dog will need to see you as both an authority figure and a friend. It must be trained to come to you when very young."

The distinctive eyebrows and beard add to its expression, which is keen and sharp.\nNicknamed the Diehard in reference to its rugged character, the Scottish terrier is a tough, determined character, ready for action. It is fearless and feisty and may be aggressive toward other dogs and animals. It is reserved, but friendly, with strangers, and devoted to its family.

The small, close ears and small, sunken eyes afford further protection. The gait is free, with good reach and drive. The wide, powerful jaws, scowling expression and hippopotamus muzzle create a look unique to the breed.\nThe Shar-Pei is self-assured, serious, independent, stubborn and very much self-possessed. Although not particularly demonstrative, it is devoted and very protective of its family. It is reserved, even suspicious, toward strangers. It can be aggressive toward other dogs and may chase livestock and other animals, although it is generally good with other family pets. The Shar-Pei needs daily mental and physical stimulation, but its needs can be met with lively games throughout the day or a good long walk. It is not generally amenable to exclusive outdoor living, but it can divide its time between house and yard. The coat needs only weekly brushing, but wrinkles need regular attention to ensure that no irritations develop within the skin folds.\n",

Its small size imparts a surprising agility, while its heavy musculature provides great strength. The wide head provides ample room for attachment of jaw muscles. Its gait should be powerful and agile. Its coat is smooth, short and close.\nThe Staffordshire bull terrier is a fun-loving character that loves playing with its family and friends. It is typically playful, companionable, amiable, docile and generally responsive to its owner's wishes. Its love of a good game is rivaled only by its need for human companionship. It is also characteristically friendly toward strangers. Some can be strong-willed. Although it doesn't usually look for a fight, it is fearless and tenacious. It may not do well around strange dogs or sometimes even household dogs that challenge it. It is generally very good with children; although usually gentle, some can be rambunctious. In the United Kingdom the Stafford is known as the Nanny Dog, in reference to its eagerness and ability to assume the role of a child's nursemaid.\n",

The gait is free and light-footed; the expression is piercingly keen. The straight, single coat is silky and glossy, following the body outline rather than falling to the floor.\nThe silky terrier is no mellow lap dog.

The gait while trotting gets most of its propulsion from the rear quarters. The expression, like the attitude, is keen; the carriage is alert and expectant. The coat is flat, hard and dense, also with a short, fine undercoat.\nThe Smooth Fox Terrier is friendly, alert, active, and lively without being high-strung. Through his keen expression and alert bearing, ears up and tail quivering, the Smooth Fox Terrier gives the impression of a dog ready to go anywhere and take on any task. The Smooth Fox Terrier is bold but not aggressive with people. They are affectionate with children but may be too active for some. Although seldom used for hunting now, the Smooth Fox Terrier retains a strong prey drive and will dig tirelessly after any underground vermin.\n",

This breed has a wide range of equally acceptable types, reflecting the wide area over which it was developed.\nThe Saluki tends to be aloof and reserved with strangers. It is extremely devoted to its own family, but it is not particularly demonstrative. The Saluki is very gentle with children, but it may not be playful enough to satisfy most of them. Extremely sensitive, it does not take to rough-and-tumble play or deal well with harsh corrections. Some Salukis can be shy. This breed is very quiet and sedate indoors, seeking out a soft, warm spot. Outside, it runs in great circles at tremendous speeds and will chase any small running animals or fast-moving objects.

Their tails are usually docked in the US, but undocked tails are not a fault in conformation showing if the dog was bred in a non-docking country. The head should be strong and carried with elegance. The skull is flat and the top is parallel with the top of the muzzle. The nose, eye-rims and paw pads are the same colour as the darkest part of the coat or darker. The eyes are expressive and set fairly wide apart. They should be hazel, chestnut or dark brown in colour, depending on the coat colour. The ears are set at medium height on the skull, and are triangular.\nThe SWD is diligent, loyal, affectionate, and intelligent. They have very strong natural herding and guarding instincts, leading them to become the \"self-appointed\" guardians of their homes. SWDs thrive on work and play. Their athleticism and extremely hard working nature leads them to excel at any number of tasks. They can be wary with strangers, and early and continuing socialization with a variety of people and other animals is essential for a well-adjusted, social dog. Good socialization at an early age greatly helps them cohabit with small children.\n",

This is a keen, alert and determined breed and should look the part.\nOne of the calmer terriers, the Sealyham is nonetheless ready for action, always happy to investigate, dig or give chase. It is often aggressive toward other dogs or pets. It is a well-mannered house dog but needs some daily exercise. It is reserved with strangers, but devoted to its family.

Its movement is deliberate and rolling because of its short legs and comparatively wide body, a gait that emphasizes power over speed. The abundant body coat is flat or slightly wavy, giving protection from thorns. A distinctive feature is the long feather between the toes, which should be long enough to cover the toenails. The expression is somber and serious, even frowning, but the wagging tail belies its true nature. The Sussex tends to bark when hunting, which helps the hunter locate it in thick cover.\nThe Sussex spaniel tends to be less playful and demonstrative than other spaniels, with a lower energy level. This makes it better suited for city life, but it still appreciates the chance to take to the wilds and hunt up birds. It tends to bark when hunting, which has made it less popular with hunters than other breeds; some also bark or howl when not hunting. At home it is calm, steady and easygoing, although it may be aggressive to strange dogs. Its somber expression is misleading because it is quite cheerful.\n",

Such a coat imparts a weather- (and dirt-) resistant quality, an essential asset in cold, damp climates.\nThe Scottish deerhound is mellow, low-key and easygoing — a gracious and well-mannered addition to the home. Outdoors, it loves to run and chase anything that moves. Indoors, it needs plenty of room to stretch on a soft surface. The deerhound is independent but willing to please; it is extremely sensitive.

The Skye's short legs enable it to go to ground in pursuit of fox and badger, and the long back imparts flexibility within a confined space. Its strong jaws further aid it in dispatching its prey. Its movement is free and effortless. The hard outer coat and close undercoat afford protection from the teeth of its quarry as well as harsh weather. The outer coat lies straight and flat, 5½ inches or more in length.\nThe Skye terrier's soft look belies its tough nature. It is a fearless and a deadly rodent hunter. It is also a mild-mannered house pet, one of the few terriers calm enough to live in the city. It still needs daily exercise in a safe area or on leash, however. It is sensitive yet stubborn. The Skye is affectionate with its family but cautious with strangers. It gets along fairly well with other dogs in the same household but may not mingle well with strange dogs. It is extremely courageous and game and makes a good watchdog.\n",

It is an ancient breed, treasured in North Africa for its hunting skills, speed, agility, and endurance over long distances. It is a robust, but elegant and racy, pursuit dog with no exaggeration of length of body or limbs, muscle development, angulation, nor curve of loin. The Sloughi is not a fragile dog, but is also a dog with class and grace. The attitude is noble and somewhat aloof, and the expression of the dark eyes is gentle and melancholy. The Sloughi's head is long and elegant with drop ears. The body and legs show defined bony structure and strong, lean muscles. The skeletal structure is sturdy. The topline is essentially horizontal blending into a bony, gently sloping croup. The tail is long and carried low with an upward curve at the end.\nThe Sloughi is an intelligent and very driven hunter which chases on sight what it considers moving prey, but also relies on olfactory and acoustic cues in the chase. In Africa the Sloughi is a working dog, primarily used for hunting. The Sloughi is typically loyal, playful and affectionate with family and cautious and watchful with strangers. The Sloughi does not respond well to harsh training, but benefits from a firm, consistent, fair and praising hand. (Faults: Sharpness or excessive shyness.)\n",

        "detail": "Galgos are similar in appearance to Greyhounds, but are distinctly different in their conformation. Galgos are higher in the rear than in the front, and have flatter muscling than a Greyhound, which is characteristic of endurance runners. They also tend to be smaller, lighter in build, have longer tails and have a very long, streamlined head that gives the impression of larger ears. Their chests are not as deep as a Greyhound's and should not reach the point of the elbow. Unlike Greyhounds, Galgos come in two coat types: smooth and rough. The rough coat can provide extra protection from skin injuries while running in the field. They come in a variety of colors and coat patterns. Main colors are \"barcino\" or \"atigrado\" (brindle), \"negro\" (black), \"barquillo\"(golden), \"tostado\"(toasted), \"canela\" (cinnamon), \"amarillo\"(yellow), \"rojo\"(red), \"blanco\" (white), \"berrendo\" (white with patches) or \"pío\" (any colour with white muzzle and forehead).\nGalgos have a very similar nature to Greyhounds. They are calm, quiet, gentle and laid back; happy to sleep their day away on their backs on a sofa. More than 90% of Galgos can be considered cat-friendly and are therefore an ideal choice for the hound lover who also owns cats. Almost all Galgos are also friendly towards other dogs and small dogs. Galgos are also very good with children, being calm in the house so there is less risk of a child being knocked over or jumped on than with a more excitable breed. They are very gentle and tolerate the often over-enthusiastic attentions of children with little risk of retaliation from the dog. Galgos have a very reserved personality and they have a tendency towards shyness, so it is very important that they be socialized early in life so that they grow up to be comfortable around strange people, dogs and locations.\n",

In upright posture the dog displays flowing outlines with a horizontally carried, well flagged tail. The dog should appear to be strong and balanced with a distinguished head. Its front legs are well feathered, the hind legs with breeches. The coat should be medium length, glossy, dense, and straight or slightly wavy. The dog's movement should be graceful and far reaching. The coloration of the dog is large patches of brown on a ticked or solid white background.\nSmall Münsterländers are extremely intelligent, trainable, and attentive but require gentle and patient training. Coupled with their intelligence, if they determine an owner to be inconsistent or indecisive, the owner might find that the dog will challenge the owner. For training, both voice and hand signals are used, and a Small Münsterländer will routinely look back to check in with the hunter for silent signals at intervals when on hold or pointing. They have a very strong prey drive and enjoy rewarding their owner with productive hunts. They thrive with hunting or comparable challenging exercise for an hour or more every day. They are strong swimmers, especially when compared to other short-haired hunting breeds.\n",

        "detail": "The Šarplaninac is a large, strongly built dog. The body is slightly longer than the height at the withers, and the front legs account for approximately 55% of the height. The head is large but proportional to the body, with dark eyes. All Šarplaninac are solid in colour: fawn, iron grey, white or almost black; usually sable or gray with darker \"overalls\" on the head and back, the undercoat being paler. The colour need not be completely uniform, and most Šarplaninac have several different shades of the same colour fading into one another. There are no bicolours and no uniformly black-coated dogs among purebreds, but odd-coloured specimens do exist. The dogs must not have large white patches in their coat.\nThe temperament of the breed is described as independent, reliable, protective but not snappy, incorruptible and devoted to its master. The breed is aloof with outsiders, and calm until a threat to the flock presents itself. The breed has an extremely protective nature. In the absence of a flock of sheep, the Šarplaninac will often treat its humans as sheep - herding them away from danger or undesirable areas. They are serene and majestic, gentle with children and smaller dogs. They are also highly intelligent and bred to work without human supervision while guarding the flocks in the high pastures. Young pups can kill small animals until trained not to hunt. Like many of its cousin Mountain dogs, the Šarplaninac is a very serious and dedicated guard dog. Due to this, they are naturally suspicious of strangers and will need good socializing at a young age to lessen this innate personality trait. They are calm and gentle with their family but when faced with danger they become a formidable foe, not a suitable breed for all. Consistent and firm training is essential to ensure compliance.\n",

Colours and markings are considered of little importance; eyes may be brown, blue or any combination of the two colours. Seppalas are active and energetic but very docile and trainable.\nThe defining characteristics of the breed are its natural, primitive appearance, its highly developed work ethic, and its affectionate, cooperative, and highly bonded nature. They tend to be more trainable than other sled dogs and to be more highly bonded to their owners. The Seppälä Siberian Sleddog disposition is active, merry, and often quite inquisitive, although sometimes showing great reserve with strangers. A stable and serious temperament, neither nervous nor aggressive, is characteristic. Natural, innate sleddog mentality is a primary characteristic of Seppälä dogs. Their nature is highly cooperative. They show great seriousness in their work in harness.\n",

These colors consist usually of a light brown, a light red-brown, or a light black-brown. In addition, there is a cream colored coat that tends to be very rare. In all of these colors there is usually a mixture of white found around the underside of the body, near the eyes, snout, and legs. The Shikoku tends to shed its coat at least one to two times a year. The dog has a fairly thick coat with pointed ears and a curved tail. The body conformation is typically of the spitz-type: the square body, the wedge-shaped head, the prick triangular ears, and feathered curled tail.\nIt is cautious and brave; a temperate dog with good judgment. The Shikoku is also very loyal and submissive to its owner; it loves to be touched and often likes to give kisses. Although, it may be slightly aloof with strangers. This breed needs socialization early to avoid becoming aggressive toward other dogs. Dogs that do become dog aggressive need a competent owner/trainer who knows how to communicate to the dog that this is unacceptable behavior. Shikokus can get along with children if they are raised properly and vice-versa. They have a high prey drive and therefore may not be for everyone; should not be trusted with non-canine pets such as guinea pigs and hamsters.\n",

The width and length of the skull are approximately equal with a gently defined stop, strong developed cheekbones, and a gradually tapering muzzle. The muzzle should be predominantly black, the length being equal to that of the forehead, with the lips firmly fitted and solid black. The muzzle should not be long, narrow or snipey in appearance. Both upper and lower thighs are well muscled. The tail is quite long and thickly covered with dense hair, hanging down like a plume. The coat comes in two varieties: smooth and plush. The plush coat is medium-length with a dense undercoat and has a distinct mane from the neck to the chest. Hair should not be more than 5\" (12 cm) in length. The smooth coat is thick and medium-length with the outer hair being harsh to the touch.\nBred as companions, Shilohs have loyal and outgoing personalities. Many of the breeders in the United States operate out of large farms where the puppies are introduced to a large variety of animals. They were developed to be gentle and loving, able to work with animals and children, while still possessing a trainable drive for working applications, such as assistive service, obedience, or herding. Shiloh Shepherds are reported to be the least territorial when compared to other Shepherd breeds. With proper socialization they adapt easily to a variety of environments and are stable. Extreme aggression or shyness is severely penalized in the breed standard.\n",

Its classic lines and athletic build are the hallmarks of a true coursing dog. When viewing a Silken Windhound, one has the impression of grace, balance and strength integrated with exceptional running ability. In proportion, they are approximately square or slightly rectangular. Silkens that are excessively longer or shorter than they are tall are to be penalized to the extent of the deviation. The build of the Silken Windhound is sleek, through a balanced combination of fine bladed bone and smooth muscle, and never looks frail.\nSilken Windhounds are affectionate and playful and are good dogs for families with children. Owing to their friendliness, they are not good guard dogs but are easily house broken and can be trained to live with smaller household pets. Silkens particularly like agility, therapy, flyball, and obedience. Silken Windhounds are often intelligent and easily trained using reward and affection in short, positive sessions and will work eagerly and form strong relationships with their owners if so treated. Like many sighthounds, Silken Windhounds can slip out of buckle collars, so most owners favour semi-slip collars.\n",

The most common coloring of the breed is a mostly black coat with tan markings, although the markings can range in color from shades of amber to a reddish brown. They have a tough, robust body which is compact and almost square in shape. It is the smallest of the Swedish hounds,[8] on average they measure between 16–21 inches (41–53 cm) at the withers with males being slightly larger than females. Average weight is around 33–44 pounds (15–20 kg) for both genders. The Smålandsstövare has a natural bobtail due to this being specifically bred into the breed, and a typical member of the breed should be well muscled in proportion throughout. The facial features include wide nostrils on a black nose, the jaw closes in a scissors bite and the eyes are typically dark brown. The skull itself is lean with a well defined stop. The ears have rounded tips, and are set fairly high on the skull, hanging flat down the sides.\nA popular Swedish hunting dog, members of the breed can form strong attachments to their master; but are also seen as household pets due to their gentle and protective nature. In hunting, they are used to drive the quarry for the hunter. They are a highly intelligent breed, and require a high level of exercise. They therefore are not best suited to living in a small apartment. Smålandsstövare are wary of strangers and can be territorial, but this can also make a Smålandsstövare a good watchdog. Participation in field trials for Smålandsstövares are becoming increasingly common. They remain active up until around twelve years old.\n",

It has small eyes and drop ears resembling triangles. This dog's coat is most often fawn-colored, but can also be brindle, black or 'wolf' colored. Reddish tones indicate miscegenation.\nThis noble giant is aloof, dignified, calm and intelligent. It is devoted to its family and may politely accept strangers if it has been socialized properly, although it will be wary of them. It can be aggressive toward other dogs. The Spanish Mastiff may be a less-than-ideal pet in urban situations, where its booming voice and massive size could be problematic. It is a wonderful protector of its home and family. And an ideal protector of herds and flocks from wolf predation. Socialization and training should begin early to ensure this dog a stable and reliable pet. Supervised exposure in puppy-hood to a variety of unfamiliar but non-threatening dogs will help dampen a tendency to aggression toward other dogs. The breed is quite alert and food motivated but can bore easily; training must be consistent and firm but gentle. Once the trainer has established the dog's respect as leader, the Spanish Mastiff will be an extremely loyal pet.\n",

'Dog Breed Info' says the Zuchon is a dog \"known for his endearing face, large expressive eyes, and his soft teddy-bear coat.\" The Zuchon usually has a longer coat that does not shed very much, if at all. This longer coat may lead to more time for maintenance and grooming. As hypoallergenic dogs, Zuchons are generally more suitable for homes with allergy problems amongst the inhabitants, although allergic reactions may still occur.\nThis toy dog is said to have a \"great\" personality, and it is playful, lively and well-mannered. They can be a bit stubborn, but when they are trained well, they are a good family pet. They are easily trained. The Zuchon is a well-mannered dog known to be social, happy, and gentle. They become devoted to their families but need much attention and do not do well when left alone for long periods of time. They are good therapy dogs. Sometimes the Zuchon may be stubborn and in need of training. The Zuchon will remain active. They make fairly good watch dogs. When necessary, this dog will bark to alert its family that someone is nearby. This breed is typically good with other pets, especially when socialized at an early age. This dog gets along well with children, but it may be a good idea to socialize this breed at an early age as well as to supervise play time with children to make sure that the dog does not get hurt as a result of its small size.\n",

Brown and white Stabyhouns are less common, but may be seen in the Netherlands, while the orange and white coated Stabyhouns are becoming increasingly rare. Spotting and/or roan in the white are acceptable, but tricolor is considered a fault. Males are 53 cm (21 in) and females are 49 cm (19 in), measured at the withers. The ideal weight of a Stabyhoun is 40 lb (18 kg) for a female and 50–55 lb (23–25 kg) for a male.\nThe Stabyhoun has a gentle disposition. This breed is friendly, sensitive, intelligent, peaceful, patient, and willing to please, but may be stubborn on occasion. The Stabyhoun exhibits great tolerance of children and other animals. With steady yet gentle training, this breed will be obedient and devoted to its owner. Stabyhouns should never be vicious or snappy. Although a Stabyhoun can be very calm indoors, like all sporting breeds it enjoys plenty of physical activity. Stabyhouns like to swim.\n",

This is an athletic, agile and graceful dog with surprising strength and the stamina to frolic all day. The gait is smooth and effortless. The coat is short and smooth, perfect for caressing.\nTFTs are TNT in a small bundle. Feisty and fun-loving, they are hunting terriers at heart and will spend hours investigating the yard, your cabinets and places you never knew existed. They love to play with people and toys, and make excellent companions for careful older children; however, they do not tolerate inconsiderate handling. They can entertain for hours and are also content to snuggle on a warm lap during recess. This is a one-family, even one-person, breed that doesn't warm to strangers initially. The TFT's intelligence, energy and penchant for showing off make it a quick study and impressive trick dog.\n",

Its walk is slow and deliberate, while its trot is powerful and light-footed. The whole appearance is impressive, with a solemn but kindly expression. The coat, which is noticeably heavier in males than in females, is thick and fairly long, especially around the neck and shoulders. The tail is densely coated and the hind legs well feathered on the upper parts. The hair is coarse, straight and hard, standing off from the body. It carries a heavy undercoat in cold weather, but little undercoat in warm weather. This combination of coat types allows the Tibetan Mastiff to endure the extremes of Tibetan weather.\nAs befitting their long past as a solitary sentry and protector, Tibetan Mastiffs are independent, strong willed, and territorial. They are aloof toward strangers but devoted to their family. Proper socialization is essential so that they will accept strangers and not become overly suspicious. They are gentle and patient with their children, but may guard their home against visiting children who may appear to be threatening the family children. They are generally good with other dogs and are rarely dog aggressive. (In Tibet, they were often kept with Lhasa Apsos.) Most Tibetan Mastiffs are good with other animals.\n",

It comes in three main colors of red-gray, wolf-gray and black-gray. Eyes are yellow through amber and brown, although light eyes are very rare.\nThe Tamaskan is a good family dog, being gentle with children and accepting of other dogs. His high intelligence makes him an excellent working dog and the Tamaskan has been known to exceed in agility and obedience as well as sled racing. This pack dog prefers not to be left alone for long periods of time. It is better suited to other human or canine company. Be sure you are this dog's pack leader, providing plenty of daily mental and physical exercise to avoid separation anxiety. The objective in training this dog is to achieve pack leader status. It is a natural instinct for a dog to have an order in its pack. When we humans live with dogs, we become their pack. The entire pack cooperates under a single leader. Lines are clearly defined. You and all other humans MUST be higher up in the order than the dog. That is the only way your relationship can be a success.\n",

The length of body from point of buttocks to point of sternum is about 10 percent longer than the height measured at the withers. The depth of chest is equal to the length of the foreleg. The tail is carried vertically or curved like a sickle. This breed is characterized by a ridge of hair growing in the opposite direction to the rest of the coat. This ridge starts at the withers and extends down the spine to the top of the pelvis bones.\nUntil recently the Thai Ridgeback was relatively unknown outside of eastern Thailand and is very rare elsewhere. This breed is a good watch, guard and hunting dog, but also makes a nice companion. Tough and active with excellent jumping ability. It is a very active and alert dog but also without socialization can be a bit aloof toward strangers. May be difficult to train. The Thai Ridgeback needs a dominant owner who understands the breed. One who has natural authority, in a firm but calm manner; confident and consistent with the rules placed upon the dog. A Thai’s owner that does not correct the dog at the proper times may find that the dog develops aggressive tendencies. With the right handler it is never too late to curb any unwanted behaviors once the owners learn how to properly treat the dog, along with providing the proper mental and physical exercise.\n",

The ratio between the length of the skull and the muzzle is 1:1. Skin is thick and well-fitting all over the body.\nTornjak has a calm temperament. A typical adult Tornjak is very calm, peaceful, at first sight an indifferent animal, but when the situation demands it, it is a vigilant and very alert watchdog. The character is equal to the temperament; they are not nervous nor aggressive. In general, they are very tough, not too demanding, sturdy dogs. With their human family they are very emotional. When living in a pack they are highly social animals and there isn't any fighting between the pack members. Towards strangers or other animals, as a rule, Tornjak is not overly aggressive. But when the situation calls upon it, Tornjak is quite decisive and it can without any consideration attack even much stronger rivals. Shepherds used to say that a Tornjak who guards the flock is a fair match to two wolves, and a couple will confront and chase away a bear without any undue respect. In these situations Tornjaks are very tenacious.\n",

The head is large and broad with a boxy muzzle, pendulous flews, and clearly observable dewlap. There is wrinkling on the head, particularly when the dog is alert. Ears are of medium size, drop, and set high. The tail is uncut, very thick at the base, and tapering to the tip. The Tosa Ken may be solid colored, brindle, black with markings, or pied. The overall appearance should be that of a massive but dynamic and flexible athlete, a true canine samurai.\nThe Tosa Ken is normally a tranquil, quiet, and obedient dog with a calm but vigilant demeanor. The Tosa is quietly affectionate with its own family but may be somewhat aloof with strangers. This breed is also by nature watchful of other dogs and may react aggressively to dogs it considers intruders. Overtly aggressive behavior toward humans is uncharacteristic of the breed and highly undesirable. The Tosa responds best to positive-enforced training methods because of an inherent desire to please its owner. This breed matures slowly and individual dogs may not reach their prime until as late as four years of age.\n",

Their coats can vary in texture from short and smooth to medium length and color including black, blue merle or blue ticked with white and / or tan trim. They usually have smooth or medium length coats (1 to 3 inches). Texas Heelers are generally prick eared, but their ears may also fold over. They usually stand between 17-22 inches (43–61 cm) tall.

These passages were often so narrow that the dog could not turn around. Short legs aided in maneuverability in the cramped passages. It had to have formidable teeth and jaws in order to face a fox in closed quarters. The harsh double coat, especially the hard, straight outer coat, provided protection from the fox's teeth, especially around the head, as well as from the elements. The tail needed to be sufficiently long to provide a handhold by which the dog could be pulled from shallow holes.\nThe busy Westie is happy, curious and always in the thick of things. It is affectionate and demanding, one of the friendliest terriers. It is not friendly, however, toward small animals. It enjoys a daily romp in a safe area or a walk on lead, as well as playtime at home. It is independent and somewhat stubborn. It barks and digs.\n",

It is square or slightly longer than tall. The gait is low and free-moving. The expression is keen and alert.\nPerhaps the most demonstrative and obedient of the true sighthounds, the whippet makes an ideal pet for people who want a quiet house dog and absolutely devoted companion. The whippet is extremely gentle with children and can make an excellent companion for them. It is calm indoors but loves to run and play outdoors.

The abundant facial furnishings contribute to its friendly expression.\nThe wirehaired pointing griffon is a skilled field dog, pointing and retrieving with a deliberate style, generally staying within the hunter's gun range.

The gait while trotting gets most of its propulsion from the rear quarters. The expression, like the attitude, is keen; the carriage is alert and expectant. The coat is dense, wiry, broken and twisted, almost appearing like coconut matting, with a short, fine undercoat. The outer coat may be crinkled, but it should not be curly.\nA true \"live-wire,\" the wire fox terrier is always up for adventure. This breed lives to play, explore, run, hunt and chase. It can be mischievous and independent and may dig and bark. It is usually fairly reserved with strangers.

The expression is soft.\nLess exuberant that the English springer, the Welsh springer spaniel is steady and easygoing. It still needs plenty of hard exercise, however, as it loves to hunt for birds.

One important aspect to consider is that the WSL does not have natural dog body odor as with most modern breeds. A clean WSL even when wet does not smell \"doggy\". It will develop a warm climate coat once adapted to the warmth. The WSL is a naturally clean natured dog. Outside of seasonal shedding the breed is a clean companion. Its coat has the ability to naturally shed off dirt due to not having an oily coat as some modern dogs have."

Their coat is thick and curly except for the head, ears and legs, where the coat is smoother; the water repellant coat is described as having a greasy feel. Coat colour may be solid black or brown, or black with white, or brown with white, with or without white ticking or roan marks. The texture of the coat should not be woolly, as such fur will not resist water. The ears are low set and hang flat to the head, and the tail curls tightly over the back. The breed has an unusual, somewhat grim expression due to the shape of the eyes, which marks it as different from other dog breeds.\nThis breed is an excellent gun dog, effective as both a land and water retriever, however its strong will and natural guarding abilities make early training a requirement. The breed standard describes the breed's temperament as reserved and \"an ideal guard-dog\". though never aggressive, which makes it an excellent family-dog. Although described as \"strong willed\" the Wetterhoun is never stubborn or wilfully disobedient. Perseverance is a much better term, because they finish what they started, whatever it takes. Imperturbable they finish what they think to be their task. Thereby the breed is sensitive and should never be treated or trained harshly. Brought-up and used to children, they are tolerant to children to the point where the dog should be protected against the children instead the other way around.\n",

Their name is derived from the name of the Aztec Indian god Xolotl and Itzcuintli, the Aztec word for dog. With a reputation as a healer, the breed and its warm skin is often put to use in remote Mexican and Central American villages to ward off and cure ailments like rheumatism, asthma, toothache and insomnia. Xolos were also believed to safeguard the home from evil spirits and intruders.\nThey make excellent companion dogs. Xolo need a consistent training regiment and clearly defined boundaries. A training class for puppies is strongly recommended. Young dogs require a substantial amount of exercise and structured playtime. Bored Xolos may entertain themselves in ways you don’t find acceptable. An ideal Xolo owner is someone looking for a dog who will be a complete companion - guardian, friend and playmate. Xolos are fine as only dogs, but also sharing a home with children or other pets.\n",

The hair is parted on the muzzle and from the base of the skull to the end of the tail. The body is square and evenly proportioned. The dog’s high head carriage and confident manner gives the appearance of vigor and self-importance.\nThe Yorkshire Terrier is tolerant of older children, provided they respect its personal space. Due to its small size and bold temperament (which arises from its working origins) the Yorkshire Terrier is not recommended for young children unless carefully supervised. The Yorkshire Terrier can occasionally be a bit too brave when dealing with larger dogs, but gets along fine with cats and other household pets. Yorkies prefer life indoors, and are especially unsuited to cold climates.\n",

These hunting dogs could penetrate into badger and fox burrows. The breed is not very old, but its origins are not entirely certain. However, it seems likely that Scotsmen seeking work in the woolen mills of Yorkshire brought with them various types of terrier, including the Skye Terrier, Dandie Dinmont, Manchester Terrier, Maltese and the now-extinct Clydesdale (Paisley Terrier). These were then crossed with local types, such as the longhaired Leeds Terrier. At first, the Yorkie was a much bigger animal than the one we see today, but by selectively breeding the smallest individuals, the dog was gradually miniaturized over the years. It was made into a fashion dog. Women carried these little dogs in their bags and under their arms. The Yorkshire Terrier was first recognized by the AKC in 1885.\n",

The length of body is just slightly longer than tall, but bitches may be somewhat longer in body than dogs. The length of the front leg (measured from point of elbow to the ground) is approximately equal to one-half of the dog’s height at the withers. The head is powerful with a broad, slightly domed skull and a powerful muzzle that is slightly higher at the nose than the stop, when viewed in profile. Ears may be cropped, or hang naturally, close to the skull. The Dogo Argentino should be evaluated as a hunting dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.\nThe Dogo is an intelligent and courageous dog with a strong, natural instinct to protect its home and family. Dogos are very social dogs and are happiest when included in all family activities. Dogos make a strong distinction between familiar people and strangers, so it is imperative that they be well trained and socialized at an early age. Dogos are hunters of great courage and endurance, and will work individually or in packs. They have also successfully been used in police protection work. An unsteady temperament is a serious fault.\n",

Each of the three coat varieties has special attributes: The smooth is short and shining, imparting some protection against the elements; the longhair is sleek, sometimes slightly wavy, providing somewhat more protection; the wire has tight, thick and hard hair with a finer undercoat, providing maximal protection.\nThe dachshund is bold, curious and always up for adventure. It likes to hunt and dig, tracking by scent and going to ground after game. It is independent but will join in its family's activities whenever given a chance. It is good with children in its own family, but some may snap at strange children. Most are reserved with strangers. Some bark. The longhaired variety may be quieter and less terrier-like; the wires may be more outgoing. Some miniatures are more prone to be timid.\n",

The ears are long, drop, and densely feathered. The tail is normally docked, set high, and carried erect. The length of body (sternum to point of buttocks) is equal to the height (withers to ground). The Standard Poodle carries himself with an air of dignity and pride. The Standard Poodle should be evaluated as a working gun dog and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.\nThe Standard Poodle’s most readily identifiable characteristic is its harsh, dense coat, which is presented in various traditional trims or, less frequently, corded. Another essential characteristic is proper temperament. The breed is noted for its high intelligence, trainability and sense of humor. Poodles are highly social and require human companionship and regular, close interaction with family members. Because of their great intelligence and the joy they take in human companionship, Poodles excel in performance events of all sorts. They are extremely affectionate with children.\n",

The German variety has probably influenced the modern breed most (‘Poodle’ is German for ‘splash’ or ‘puddle’). In 18th and 19th century Europe, the Poodle served a wide variety of purposes, including duck hunting, guiding, and later circus performing, from whence the modern grooming style likely arose. The Poodle became a popular pet for the French aristocracy, and in time was officially adopted as the national dog. Poodles were imported to America in the 20th century. They slowly rose in popularity and eventually became the country’s most popular dog. The poodle is a group of formal dog breeds, the Standard Poodle, Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle. The origins of the poodles are still discussed with a dispute over whether the poodle descends from the old French Barbet breed or from Germany as a type of water dog.\n",

The coat is short and fine. An extremely handsome and graceful dog, the Rajapalayam has a gait similar to the trotting of a thoroughbred horse.\nThe Rajapalayam was used predominantly for hunting wild boar and as a formidable guard dog.They are sight hounds by nature but it was proved that by a little training they can be also a Scent hound. All depends on the trainer. It needs wide open spaces and is very affectionate and devoted towards its owner, although not always demonstrative. They do not usually like to be touched or handled by strangers and are known to be one-person dogs. Rajapalayams are largely aggressive and hostile towards strangers, and will attack intruders. Socialization in puppyhood is important. They usually do not get along well with other pets like cats, owing to their strong hunting instincts.\n",

Its stiff bristly coat further afforded protection against bites. The coat can be of either brush (not to exceed 1 inch) or horse (very short) types, both should be extremely harsh, straight and stand off the body. The small, close ears and small, sunken eyes afford further protection. The gait is free, with good reach and drive. The wide, powerful jaws, scowling expression and hippopotamus muzzle create a look unique to the breed.\nThe Shar-Pei is self-assured, serious, independent, stubborn and very much self-possessed. Although not particularly demonstrative, it is devoted and very protective of its family. It is reserved, even suspicious, toward strangers. It can be aggressive toward other dogs and may chase livestock and other animals, although it is generally good with other family pets. The Shar-Pei needs daily mental and physical stimulation, but its needs can be met with lively games throughout the day or a good long walk. It is not generally amenable to exclusive outdoor living, but it can divide its time between house and yard. The coat needs only weekly brushing, but wrinkles need regular attention to ensure that no irritations develop within the skin folds.\n",

Ears are of medium size, drop, and set high. The tail is uncut, very thick at the base, and tapering to the tip. The Tosa Ken may be solid colored, brindle, black with markings, or pied. The overall appearance should be that of a massive but dynamic and flexible athlete, a true canine samurai.\nThe Tosa Ken is normally a tranquil, quiet, and obedient dog with a calm but vigilant demeanor. The Tosa is quietly affectionate with its own family but may be somewhat aloof with strangers. This breed is also by nature watchful of other dogs and may react aggressively to dogs it considers intruders. Overtly aggressive behavior toward humans is uncharacteristic of the breed and highly undesirable. The Tosa responds best to positive-enforced training methods because of an inherent desire to please its owner. This breed matures slowly and individual dogs may not reach their prime until as late as four years of age.\n",

The breed's smaller size has moved it from the realm of sled dog, but it remains a sled dog in miniature. Its trot is agile and bold. The expression is keen and alert.\nThe American Eskimo is bright, eager to please, lively and fun-loving — in short, an enjoyable and generally obedient companion. True to its spitz heritage, it is independent and tenacious and loves to run, especially in cold weather. But it is among the most biddable of spitz breeds, and it is calm and well-mannered inside.

The length of body is just slightly longer than tall, but bitches may be somewhat longer in body than dogs. The length of the front leg (measured from point of elbow to the ground) is approximately equal to one-half of the dog’s height at the withers. The head is powerful with a broad, slightly domed skull and a powerful muzzle that is slightly higher at the nose than the stop, when viewed in profile. Ears may be cropped, or hang naturally, close to the skull. The Dogo Argentino should be evaluated as a hunting dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.\nThe Dogo is an intelligent and courageous dog with a strong, natural instinct to protect its home and family. Dogos are very social dogs and are happiest when included in all family activities. Dogos make a strong distinction between familiar people and strangers, so it is imperative that they be well trained and socialized at an early age. Dogos are hunters of great courage and endurance, and will work individually or in packs. They have also successfully been used in police protection work. An unsteady temperament is a serious fault.\n",

Its confidence, hunting instinct, keen nose and loud voice also are of significant aid in hunting underground. Agility, freedom of movement and endurance are necessary for the dachshund's work, and its gait is fluid and smooth. The dachshund has an energetic, pleasant expression. Each of the three coat varieties has special attributes: The smooth is short and shining, imparting some protection against the elements; the longhair is sleek, sometimes slightly wavy, providing somewhat more protection; the wire has tight, thick and hard hair with a finer undercoat, providing maximal protection.\nThe dachshund is bold, curious and always up for adventure. It likes to hunt and dig, tracking by scent and going to ground after game. It is independent but will join in its family's activities whenever given a chance. It is good with children in its own family, but some may snap at strange children. Most are reserved with strangers. Some bark. The longhaired variety may be quieter and less terrier-like; the wires may be more outgoing. Some miniatures are more prone to be timid.\n",

The Dachshund was recognized as a distinct breed in 1910 and has gradually increased in popularity to become a favored pet.

The Standard Poodle carries himself with an air of dignity and pride. The Standard Poodle should be evaluated as a working gun dog and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog’s ability to work.\nThe Standard Poodle’s most readily identifiable characteristic is its harsh, dense coat, which is presented in various traditional trims or, less frequently, corded. Another essential characteristic is proper temperament. The breed is noted for its high intelligence, trainability and sense of humor. Poodles are highly social and require human companionship and regular, close interaction with family members. Because of their great intelligence and the joy they take in human companionship, Poodles excel in performance events of all sorts. They are extremely affectionate with children.\n",

In 18th and 19th century Europe, the Poodle served a wide variety of purposes, including duck hunting, guiding, and later circus performing, from whence the modern grooming style likely arose. The Poodle became a popular pet for the French aristocracy, and in time was officially adopted as the national dog. Poodles were imported to America in the 20th century. They slowly rose in popularity and eventually became the country’s most popular dog. The poodle is a group of formal dog breeds, the Standard Poodle, Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle. The origins of the poodles are still discussed with a dispute over whether the poodle descends from the old French Barbet breed or from Germany as a type of water dog.\n",

The most prized colour is milk white, with a pink nose and golden eye. In the past, puppies of colour were usually culled from the litters since the owners preferred the pure white dogs. The coat is short and fine. An extremely handsome and graceful dog, the Rajapalayam has a gait similar to the trotting of a thoroughbred horse.\nThe Rajapalayam was used predominantly for hunting wild boar and as a formidable guard dog.They are sight hounds by nature but it was proved that by a little training they can be also a Scent hound. All depends on the trainer. It needs wide open spaces and is very affectionate and devoted towards its owner, although not always demonstrative. They do not usually like to be touched or handled by strangers and are known to be one-person dogs. Rajapalayams are largely aggressive and hostile towards strangers, and will attack intruders. Socialization in puppyhood is important. They usually do not get along well with other pets like cats, owing to their strong hunting instincts.\n",

The wide, powerful jaws, scowling expression and hippopotamus muzzle create a look unique to the breed.\nThe Shar-Pei is self-assured, serious, independent, stubborn and very much self-possessed. Although not particularly demonstrative, it is devoted and very protective of its family. It is reserved, even suspicious, toward strangers. It can be aggressive toward other dogs and may chase livestock and other animals, although it is generally good with other family pets. The Shar-Pei needs daily mental and physical stimulation, but its needs can be met with lively games throughout the day or a good long walk. It is not generally amenable to exclusive outdoor living, but it can divide its time between house and yard. The coat needs only weekly brushing, but wrinkles need regular attention to ensure that no irritations develop within the skin folds.\n",

The head is large and broad with a boxy muzzle, pendulous flews, and clearly observable dewlap. There is wrinkling on the head, particularly when the dog is alert. Ears are of medium size, drop, and set high. The tail is uncut, very thick at the base, and tapering to the tip. The Tosa Ken may be solid colored, brindle, black with markings, or pied. The overall appearance should be that of a massive but dynamic and flexible athlete, a true canine samurai.\nThe Tosa Ken is normally a tranquil, quiet, and obedient dog with a calm but vigilant demeanor. The Tosa is quietly affectionate with its own family but may be somewhat aloof with strangers. This breed is also by nature watchful of other dogs and may react aggressively to dogs it considers intruders. Overtly aggressive behavior toward humans is uncharacteristic of the breed and highly undesirable. The Tosa responds best to positive-enforced training methods because of an inherent desire to please its owner. This breed matures slowly and individual dogs may not reach their prime until as late as four years of age.\n",
